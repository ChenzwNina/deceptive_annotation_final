Task 4: Location of Component
This component is designed to appear embedded at the top of the "Order Details" or "Track My Order" page, directly below the site's main navigation bar. It does not occupy a full page or function as a pop-up, but sits at the top of an existing section or page, ensuring immediate visibility when users seek order tracking information.

Task 5: Design Reasoning
The component combines a visually engaging tracking progress bar with detailed order information and actionable CTAs. Placing the tracking steps and order status at the top offers immediate clarity, reducing anxiety and increasing trust, which lowers cart abandonment and bounce rates. Prominent "Track Package Live" and "Need Help?" buttons maximize conversions by facilitating engagement and support. Including product details keeps the user focused on their order, boosting site stickiness and potential browsing of related items. The rewards bar incentivizes program signups, increasing average order size and fostering loyalty for repeat visits. The bright, branded colors and social-proof elements (like delivered estimates and step completion) further build trust and encourage advertising click-throughs by emphasizing benefits like loyalty points and free shipping. Responsive design ensures consistent user experience across devices, maximizing accessibility and repeat traffic.
