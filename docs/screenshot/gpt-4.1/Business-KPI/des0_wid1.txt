Task 4. Placement:
  This component is designed to be embedded at the very top of all main e-commerce pages (homepage, category, and product pages) as a fixed-width, full-bleed horizontal banner with a 20-pixel margin from the top of the viewport. It does NOT occupy the full page, nor does it appear as a modal/pop-up; instead, it replaces or sits just above the site header/navigation bar, making it the first interactive element visible to all visitors.

  Task 5. Design Reasoning:
  The vibrant gradient colors, urgency-driven countdown timer, prominent "Shop Now" CTA, and concise deal highlights draw immediate attention, maximizing conversion and cart size. The inclusion of multiple deal highlights promotes cross-category sales. The "View Top Picks" and "See New Arrivals" ad-style sidebar links encourage users to click through to other high-engagement areas (increasing advertising and internal promotion click rates, time on site, and page views). The sticky position at the top, mobile optimization, and compelling visuals support both new and returning user engagement. The time-limited aspect minimizes cart abandonment by encouraging faster purchase decisions, while the clarity and excitement of the offer reduce bounce rates. Altogether, this approach directly addresses all of the business rules stated.
