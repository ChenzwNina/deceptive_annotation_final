Task 4: This product item component is intended to appear at the top of a product detail page, occupying the main visible area above the fold. It is embedded as a key section within the product details page template, directly beneath the website's header/navigation bar. This placement ensures maximum visibility and interaction for every potential customer landing on a product page.

    Task 5:
    - The design prioritizes a large, clear product image and concise, benefit-focused copy, coupled with strong price anchoring (old price, percent savings) to maximize conversions and average order size (Rules 1-3, 8).
    - "Best Seller", rating, and stock urgency signals increase trust and induce purchase urgency (Rules 2, 7, 8).
    - Prominent and differentiated "Add to Cart" and "Wishlist" buttons reduce friction, minimize abandonment, and accommodate various shopping behaviors (Rules 2, 8).
    - Upsell and bundle offers plus a strong ad/banner link boost average order value and advertising revenue (Rules 3, 4).
    - Responsive interactive elements (reviews, upsell offers) encourage engagement, leading to deeper site exploration and longer time on site (Rules 5, 6).
    - The free delivery and low-stock badges address common abandonment causes and encourage conversions (Rule 8).
    - The visual hierarchy and color palette reflect credibility and brand identity, fostering return visits and minimizing bounce rate (Rules 6, 7, 9).
