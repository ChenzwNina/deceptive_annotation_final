Task 4: Component Placement
This component appears at the very top of the checkout or shopping cart page, before the order summary or payment section. It occupies the full-width container (max 820px) centered on the page with a 20-pixel margin from the top of the viewport. It is embedded (not a pop-up) and is highly visible to encourage selection of shipping options and upsell add-ons as part of the natural checkout flow.

Task 5: Design Reasoning
The design adopts a split interface (shipping left, add-ons right) for clarity. Key conversion tactics include:
- Highlighting 'FREE' standard shipping to minimize abandonment and bounce.
- Making paid express shipping visually accessible for higher order value.
- Prompting store pickup for immediate needs (helps with local engagement and quick conversions).
- Showcasing desirable add-ons (gift wrap, warranty, eco shipping) with concise, benefit-oriented descriptions to boost average order size and revenue.
- Providing immediate 'See shipping details' information reduces uncertainty, thus minimizing bounce and cart abandonment.
- Promotion at the bottom (triple rewards) incentivizes order completion, reducing abandonment.
- Clean, touch-friendly layout boosts usability, retaining users and encouraging more page views and longer time on site.
- Modern look and color cues match contemporary e-commerce branding needs and encourage interaction while supporting ad engagement and brand experience.
