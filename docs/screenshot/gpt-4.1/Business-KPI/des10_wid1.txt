Task 4: Placement
This component will appear as an embedded modal-like section at the top of the "My Account" or "Membership Settings" page, immediately after the menu or header (20px from top). It occupies a prominent place to ensure maximum user attention and engagement during the membership management process. It is not a pop-up in this implementation, but a visually isolated section within the existing account management interface.

Task 5: Design Reasoning
This design guides the user through cancellation in a conversion-focused manner. The membership summary reminds users of benefits they have, invoking loss aversion. Exclusive retention offers maximize sales, conversion, and order size by offering discounts and perks if the user stays. "Claim offer" is highlighted as the primary action, while cancellation requires a confirmatory step, reducing accidental churn. Feedback collection provides valuable data to minimize bounce and abandonment, while the help link offers real-time support for at-risk users. Strategic ad placement draws clicks without overwhelming the user. Responsive, attractive design, and clear CTAs maintain engagement, prioritizing retention and alternative monetization via advertising, thus supporting all 9 interface goals.
