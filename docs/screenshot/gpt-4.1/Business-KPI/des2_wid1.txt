Task 4: Placement Description
This search panel component is designed to be embedded at the very top portion of every page, just below the main navigation bar or site header, on the e-commerce website. It does not occupy the full page, nor is it a pop-up. Instead, it is a visually prominent section immediately visible on page load, with a 20px margin from the top of the viewport, maximizing its accessibility.

Task 5: Design Reasoning
The design prioritizes high conversion and sales by making the search experience fast, clear, and attractive. The inclusion of a brand section strengthens identity and trust, increasing return visitors and reducing bounce rates. The search bar uses encouraging placeholder text, prompting detailed search queries, increasing page views per visit. The category selector boosts order size by making it easy to find additional categories, while "Quick Links" to trending or high-revenue categories maximize click-through and discovery. The promotional message fosters urgency, boosting conversion and average order value (AOV). Modern, accessible design and mobile-friendly layouts help all users, maximizing sessions and minimizing abandonment. Page speed is optimized with static images and no scripts. The overall effect is a component that creates engagement, encourages discovery, minimizes bounce and abandonment, and supports both sales and advertising goals.
