    <!-- Question 1: The cart widget is positioned at the top-right with a white background, subtle gray borders, and a soft shadow for depth. Itâ€™s 350px wide with a max height of 400px to prevent overflow. Items are displayed in a flex layout with 50x50px images, clear typography (14px for names, 12px for prices), and a green checkout button for emphasis. Colors like green (#28a745) for checkout and red (#ff4444) for remove buttons align with e-commerce standards for action cues. These choices ensure a clean, user-friendly design that mimics popular platforms like Amazon. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears when a user clicks a cart icon in the navigation bar or adds an item to the cart. It could also display on hover over the cart icon for quick access, ensuring users can review their selections without navigating away. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can view cart contents, scroll if there are many items, remove items via the red button, and proceed to checkout with the green button. Hover effects on buttons provide visual feedback, enhancing interactivity. The widget can be closed by clicking outside or via a close trigger (not shown in code). -->
