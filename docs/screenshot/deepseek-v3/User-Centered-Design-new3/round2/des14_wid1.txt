Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a vertical timeline with color-coded status indicators: green for completed steps (#4CAF50), orange for current step (#FF9800) with pulsing animation, and gray for pending steps (#e0e0e0). The layout is organized with clear typography hierarchy - bold titles (16px), regular dates (14px), and smaller location text (13px). These design choices enhance readability, provide visual hierarchy, and use color psychology to intuitively communicate order status progression while maintaining a professional e-commerce aesthetic.

Question 2: This widget appears when users access their order history or order confirmation page after making a purchase. It can also be triggered by clicking "Track Order" from order emails, order confirmation pages, or customer account dashboards. The widget loads automatically when users navigate to specific order details pages, providing immediate visibility into order status without requiring additional actions from the user.

Question 3: Users can view the complete order timeline with status updates, dates, and locations. They can click action buttons to "Track Package" (opens carrier tracking), "View Order Details" (shows full order information), and "Contact Support" (initiates customer service contact). The timeline is visually interactive with hover effects on buttons and animated current status indicators. Users can also copy the order number for reference and understand delivery progress through the color-coded visual timeline that clearly distinguishes completed, current, and pending stages.
