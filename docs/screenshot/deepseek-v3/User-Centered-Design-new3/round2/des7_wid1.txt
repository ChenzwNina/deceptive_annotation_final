Question 1: The widget features a clean, professional design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and subtle shadow for depth. Key elements include a large blue average rating (4.7), gold stars for visual appeal, and horizontal bars showing rating distribution. The layout is organized hierarchically with clear visual separation between sections. These design choices enhance readability, use color psychology (blue for trust, gold for quality), and provide immediate visual understanding of the product's rating distribution while maintaining a modern, trustworthy appearance.

Question 2: This widget appears automatically when users navigate to a product detail page. It's triggered by the page load event and displays alongside product images, descriptions, and pricing information. The widget loads immediately with the page content to provide social proof and help users make informed purchasing decisions. It remains visible throughout the user's product page interaction, positioned strategically near the purchase buttons to influence buying behavior.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by scrolling through individual reviews, clicking the "Load More Reviews" button to view additional feedback, and hovering over rating bars to see exact percentages. The widget supports filtering by star rating (though not implemented here), and users can click to expand/collapse long reviews. Advanced implementations might allow users to sort reviews by date, helpfulness, or rating, and provide options to report inappropriate content or vote on review helpfulness.
