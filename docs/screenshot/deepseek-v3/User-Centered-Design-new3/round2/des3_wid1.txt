Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle border (#e0e0e0) for clarity. Elements are sized for usability - input fields and buttons have 12px padding for comfortable interaction, text is 14px for readability. The layout is organized vertically with clear sections: header, search bar, filters, and recent searches. I chose these design elements to create an intuitive, accessible interface that follows ecommerce best practices while maintaining visual hierarchy and sufficient touch targets for mobile users.

Question 2: The widget appears automatically when the page loads, simulating a common ecommerce pattern where search functionality is immediately accessible. In a production environment, this would typically be triggered by clicking a search icon in the navigation bar or header. The widget includes a close button (×) that allows users to dismiss it when not needed, providing control over the interface while keeping the search functionality readily available.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget in multiple ways: typing search queries in the input field, clicking the search button to execute searches, selecting categories and price ranges from dropdown filters, clicking recent search terms to auto-fill the search field, and closing the widget using the × button. The search button triggers the main search action while filters refine results. Recent searches provide quick access to previous queries, enhancing user efficiency. All interactive elements provide visual feedback on hover and click states.
