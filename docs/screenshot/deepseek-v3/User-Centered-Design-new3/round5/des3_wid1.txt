Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle border (#e0e0e0) for visual separation. It uses a maximum width of 600px for optimal readability on desktop while remaining responsive. The search input has a prominent blue border (#007bff) to draw attention, with adequate padding (12px) for comfortable typing. Filter controls are organized in a flexible row layout that wraps on smaller screens. These design choices prioritize usability - high contrast text ensures readability, consistent spacing creates visual hierarchy, and the color scheme aligns with professional ecommerce standards while maintaining accessibility.

    Question 2: The search panel appears when users click on the main search bar or a dedicated "Advanced Search" button typically located in the website header. It can also be triggered by keyboard shortcuts (like Ctrl+K) for power users. On mobile devices, it might appear as a full-screen overlay when the search icon is tapped. The panel provides immediate visual feedback with a smooth transition animation to indicate it's an extension of the main search functionality rather than a separate page.

    Question 3: Users can type search queries in the main input field, which supports real-time suggestions. They can refine searches using dropdown filters for category, price range, and sorting preferences. The "Clear Filters" button resets all selections, while the primary "Search" button executes the query with applied filters. The close button (×) dismisses the panel without performing a search. Keyboard navigation includes Tab to move between fields, Enter to search, and Escape to close. The interface is fully accessible with proper ARIA labels and supports screen readers.
