Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and blue accent colors (#3498db for primary actions). Product cards have subtle shadows and hover effects that lift them slightly when users interact. The layout uses a responsive grid system that adapts to different screen sizes, with cards arranged in rows that wrap appropriately. I chose these design elements to create visual hierarchy, ensure readability, and provide intuitive interaction cues. The color scheme promotes trust and professionalism while the card-based layout makes scanning products easy.

    Question 2: This featured products widget appears automatically when users land on the homepage or main product category pages. It's designed to be a permanent section that's always visible to showcase popular or promoted items. The widget loads immediately with the page content, requiring no user action to trigger its appearance. It serves as a key merchandising element to highlight special offers, best-sellers, or new arrivals that the business wants to promote to all visitors.

    Question 3: Users can hover over product cards to see elevation and shadow effects, click product cards to view detailed product pages, click "Add to Cart" buttons to immediately add items to their shopping cart, and click the "View All Products" button to navigate to a full product catalog page. The hover effects provide visual feedback, while the clickable elements enable direct purchasing actions and exploration of additional products. The responsive design also ensures these interactions work seamlessly across different device types.
