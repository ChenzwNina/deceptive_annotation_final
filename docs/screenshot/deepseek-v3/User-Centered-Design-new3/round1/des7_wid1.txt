Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and rounded corners (12px radius). The color scheme uses green (#28a745) for progress bars to indicate positive ratings, yellow stars (#ffc107) for visual appeal, and a dark green (#2c5530) for the average rating to emphasize importance. The layout is organized hierarchically with the average rating prominently displayed, followed by detailed rating distribution bars and individual user reviews. These design choices enhance readability, create visual hierarchy, and use color psychology to convey trust and positivity while maintaining professional aesthetics suitable for e-commerce.

    Question 2: The widget appears automatically when users navigate to a product page or click on a dedicated "Reviews" or "Ratings" tab. It may also trigger when users scroll down the product page to the review section, or when they click on a review count indicator. Some implementations might show the widget after purchase completion to encourage rating submission. The appearance is typically tied to product page loading or user interaction with review-related elements, ensuring it's contextually relevant and accessible when users seek social proof before making purchasing decisions.

    Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by scrolling through individual reviews, clicking the "Load More Reviews" button to view additional feedback, and hovering over rating bars to see exact percentages. They can sort reviews by rating, date, or helpfulness if sorting options are provided. Users can also submit their own ratings by clicking on star icons and writing comments in an integrated review form. Some implementations allow users to vote on review helpfulness, report inappropriate content, or filter reviews by specific criteria. The widget supports both consumption of existing ratings and contribution of new ones.
