Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a centered "Featured Products" title in dark blue (#2c3e50). Products are displayed in a responsive grid with white cards featuring subtle shadows and rounded corners. Each card includes a product image, name in dark blue, price in red (#e74c3c), description in gray (#7f8c8d), and a blue "Add to Cart" button (#3498db). Cards have hover effects with upward movement and enhanced shadows. These design choices create visual hierarchy, use color psychology (red for prices/urgency, blue for trust), and ensure excellent readability while maintaining a professional ecommerce aesthetic.

Question 2: This featured products widget appears automatically when users land on the homepage or main product category pages. It's designed to be immediately visible without requiring any user interaction to trigger its appearance. The widget loads as part of the initial page render, positioned prominently to showcase key products and drive conversions from the moment users enter the site. It may also appear on other strategic pages where product discovery is important.

Question 3: Users can hover over product cards to see elevation and shadow effects. They can click the "Add to Cart" buttons to add items directly to their shopping cart. Clicking product images or names could navigate to detailed product pages (though this functionality would need backend integration). On mobile devices, touch interactions replace hover effects. The grid layout is responsive, automatically adjusting the number of columns based on screen size. Sale badges provide visual cues for special offers, encouraging user engagement with discounted items.
