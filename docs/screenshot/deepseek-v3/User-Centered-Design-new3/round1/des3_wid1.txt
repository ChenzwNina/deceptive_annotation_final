Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle gray borders (#e0e0e0). It has rounded corners (8px border-radius) and a soft shadow for depth. The search input has a prominent blue border (#007bff) to draw attention, with input fields sized at 16px for readability. Filter sections use 14px labels in dark gray (#555555) for hierarchy. The layout is organized vertically with clear spacing between elements. These design choices prioritize usability - the clean aesthetic reduces cognitive load, the blue accent guides user focus, and the consistent spacing creates visual harmony that enhances the search experience.

    Question 2: This search widget appears when users click on the search icon or search bar in the website header. It can also be triggered by keyboard shortcuts (like Ctrl+K or Cmd+K) for power users. On mobile devices, it might appear as a slide-up panel when users tap the search icon. The widget provides an advanced search interface beyond the basic header search, offering additional filtering options that help users refine their product searches more precisely.

    Question 3: Users can type search queries in the main input field and use category and price range dropdown filters to narrow results. The search icon provides visual feedback, and the clear button resets all inputs. The close button (X) dismisses the panel, while the search button executes the query with applied filters. The input field supports keyboard navigation - users can press Enter to search or Escape to close. The design includes hover states on buttons for better interaction feedback, and the focused input border color change provides clear visual cues during text entry.
