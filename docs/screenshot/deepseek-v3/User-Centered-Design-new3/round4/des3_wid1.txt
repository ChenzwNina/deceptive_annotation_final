Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a maximum width of 600px for optimal readability. The search input is prominent with ample padding (12px) for easy interaction. Primary buttons use blue (#007bff) for clear call-to-action, while secondary elements use neutral grays. The layout is organized with clear sections for search, filters, and recent searches, using proper spacing and typography hierarchy. These design choices prioritize usability, accessibility, and visual clarity while maintaining brand consistency.

    Question 2: The widget appears when users click on the search icon in the website header or press a designated keyboard shortcut (typically Ctrl+K or Cmd+K). It can also be triggered programmatically when users navigate to specific product categories or when the system detects search intent. The widget overlays the main content to focus user attention on the search task, and can be dismissed by clicking the close button (×) or pressing the Escape key.

    Question 3: Users can type search queries in the input field and submit by pressing Enter or clicking the Search button. They can apply filters using checkboxes for "In Stock," "On Sale," and "Free Shipping." Recent search tags are clickable to quickly populate the search field. The widget supports keyboard navigation: Tab to move between elements, Escape to close, and Enter to search. Search history updates dynamically, and filter combinations refine results. The interface provides immediate visual feedback for all interactions.
