Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and subtle shadow for depth. The average rating (4.5) is prominently displayed in large blue text (2.5rem) to draw attention. Gold stars (#ffc107) provide visual appeal and familiarity. Rating bars use green (#4CAF50) for positive associations, with clear percentage labels. The layout is organized hierarchically: average rating first, followed by distribution bars, then individual reviews. This design prioritizes readability and trust-building through professional aesthetics and clear information hierarchy.

Question 2: The widget appears automatically when users navigate to a product page. It's integrated into the product detail section, typically below the product images and description but above the "Add to Cart" button. This placement ensures users see social proof before making purchase decisions. The widget loads with the page content without requiring any user interaction to trigger its display, making ratings immediately accessible during the shopping experience.

Question 3: Users can view the overall rating and distribution breakdown. They can read individual user reviews with star ratings and comments. While this implementation displays static data, in a full version users could: sort reviews by date or rating, filter by star level, click "Load More" to see additional reviews, report inappropriate content, or click to submit their own rating. The interactive elements would include hover states on stars and clickable buttons for navigation and actions, enhancing user engagement with the rating system.
