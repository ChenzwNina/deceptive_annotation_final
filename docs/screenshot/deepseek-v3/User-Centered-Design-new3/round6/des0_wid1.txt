Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and soft gray accents (#f8f9fa). Product cards have white backgrounds with subtle shadows, creating depth. The layout uses a responsive grid that adapts to screen size. I chose a blue primary color (#3498db) for buttons as it's trustworthy and encourages action. Text uses dark gray (#2c3e50) for readability with red (#e74c3c) for prices and sale badges to draw attention. The design prioritizes visual hierarchy with clear typography scales and ample white space to reduce cognitive load and guide users naturally through the content.

    Question 2: This featured products widget appears automatically when users land on the homepage or main product category pages. It's triggered by page load as part of the initial page rendering. The component is designed to be immediately visible without requiring user interaction to appear, serving as a primary content section that showcases key products to drive conversions and highlight promotions or best-selling items from the inventory.

    Question 3: Users can hover over product cards to see elevation effects (cards lift slightly). They can click "Add to Cart" buttons to add items directly to their shopping cart. The entire product card is visually interactive with hover states, though only the button triggers the cart action. Users can also view product images, read descriptions, and see pricing information. On mobile devices, touch interactions replace hover effects. The responsive grid allows users to view products in an optimized layout regardless of their screen size, with smooth transitions enhancing the interactive experience.
