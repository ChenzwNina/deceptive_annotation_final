Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and subtle border. The average rating (4.5) is prominently displayed in large, bold text (32px) in dark blue-gray (#2c3e50) for emphasis. Gold stars (#ffc107) provide visual rating representation. Rating bars use green (#28a745) progress indicators against light gray backgrounds, with clear percentage visualization. The layout is organized hierarchically with proper spacing and a prominent "Write a Review" button in blue (#007bff). These design choices prioritize readability, visual hierarchy, and trust-building through professional aesthetics.

Question 2: This ratings widget appears automatically on product detail pages when users view specific items. It loads immediately with the page content as part of the product information section. The widget is always visible to provide transparent social proof and help customers make informed purchasing decisions. It doesn't require any user action to appear but enhances the shopping experience by displaying authentic customer feedback.

Question 3: Users can visually scan the overall rating and detailed breakdown by star level. They can read the distribution of ratings through the progress bars and exact review counts. The primary interaction is clicking the "Write a Review" button, which would typically open a review submission form. Users can also use the displayed information to assess product quality and make purchasing decisions. The widget serves as both an informational display and a gateway to contributing user-generated content through the review submission feature.
