Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadows for depth. I used a purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2) for the primary button to create visual appeal and encourage clicks. Input fields have light gray backgrounds (#fafafa) with blue focus states (#4299e1) for better usability. The layout is centered with adequate spacing (40px padding) and a maximum width of 450px for optimal readability. These design choices follow modern UX principles - the gradient creates visual hierarchy, sufficient white space reduces cognitive load, and the color scheme maintains professionalism while being inviting.

Question 2: This membership widget would typically appear in several scenarios: when users first visit the website as a welcome modal, when they attempt to checkout without an account, when browsing premium products, or after spending a certain amount of time on the site. It could also be triggered by clicking a "Join Membership" button in the site header or when users show exit intent (moving cursor toward browser close button). The timing is strategic to capture user interest when they're most engaged with the brand.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by filling in the registration form fields (name, email, password), viewing the membership benefits list, submitting the form, and closing the widget via the X button. The form includes validation - fields are required and password must be at least 8 characters. On hover, the submit button lifts slightly with a shadow for tactile feedback. Clicking the terms links opens relevant pages. After submission, users receive a confirmation message. The close button includes a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental closure, improving user experience and reducing frustration.
