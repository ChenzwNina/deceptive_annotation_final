Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a centered title and responsive grid layout. Products are displayed in white cards with subtle shadows, using a blue primary color (#3498db) for buttons and red (#e74c3c) for prices to draw attention. Cards have hover effects with lift animations and enhanced shadows. I chose these colors for good contrast and visual hierarchy, with ample white space for readability. The responsive grid ensures optimal viewing on all devices, while consistent spacing and typography create a professional appearance that builds trust and encourages engagement.

Question 2: This featured products widget appears immediately when users land on the homepage or a main category page. It's designed to be a permanent section that's always visible in the main content area, typically positioned after the hero banner but before other content sections. The widget loads with the page content and doesn't require any specific user action to trigger its appearance, serving as a key merchandising element to showcase popular or promoted items to all visitors from their first interaction with the site.

Question 3: Users can hover over product cards to see lift animations and shadow enhancements. They can click the "Add to Cart" buttons to immediately add items to their shopping cart. Clicking anywhere on the product card (excluding the button) would typically navigate to the product detail page for more information. On mobile devices, touch interactions replace hover effects with tap gestures. The grid layout is responsive, automatically adjusting the number of columns based on screen size. Users can scroll through the products if they extend beyond the initial viewport.
