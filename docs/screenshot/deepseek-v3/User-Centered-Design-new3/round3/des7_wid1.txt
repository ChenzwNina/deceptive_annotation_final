Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and subtle border. Key elements include a prominent 4.5 average rating in large yellow text, visual star ratings, and percentage bars showing rating distribution. The layout is organized with clear hierarchy - average rating at top, followed by detailed breakdown bars, then individual reviews. Colors use yellow (#ffc107) for ratings to draw attention, with neutral grays for supporting text. This design prioritizes readability and quick comprehension of rating information, using spacing and visual hierarchy to guide users through the data.

Question 2: The widget appears automatically on product detail pages when users navigate to view a specific product. It loads alongside other product information such as images, descriptions, and pricing. The widget is always visible in the product information section, typically positioned near the product description or specifications to provide social proof and help users make informed purchasing decisions based on peer feedback.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by: 1) Reading individual reviews by scrolling through the displayed comments, 2) Viewing the rating distribution through the visual bar charts showing percentage of each star rating, 3) Clicking on "see more reviews" (if implemented) to expand and view additional user feedback, 4) Sorting reviews by date, rating, or helpfulness (if sorting options are available), and 5) Potentially submitting their own rating and review if they've purchased the product, though this submission functionality would typically be in a separate review submission component.
