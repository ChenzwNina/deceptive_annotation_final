Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for depth. I used a blue gradient for the submit button (#3498db to #2980b9) to create visual hierarchy and encourage action. Text colors are dark gray (#2c3e50) for headings and lighter gray (#7f8c8d) for body text to ensure readability. The layout is centered with adequate spacing (30px padding) and rounded corners (12px) for a friendly appearance. Input fields have 2px borders that turn blue on focus for clear interaction feedback. These design choices prioritize usability, accessibility, and visual appeal while maintaining a professional ecommerce aesthetic.

    Question 2: This membership widget appears as a modal overlay when users first visit the website or after they've browsed for a certain period. It could also trigger when users attempt to make a purchase without being logged in, or when they click a "Join Membership" link in the navigation. The widget is designed to capture attention at strategic moments when users are most likely to convert, such as after demonstrating interest in products or when they're about to complete a transaction.

    Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by entering their email and password in the form fields, which include real-time validation. They can click the green checkmark benefits to see detailed tooltips (if implemented). The submit button processes the form with visual feedback (hover effects and potential loading states). Users can close the widget using the "×" button in the top-right corner. After submission, they receive success/error messages. The form also supports keyboard navigation - users can tab through fields and submit with Enter. All interactions provide immediate visual feedback through color changes and transitions.
