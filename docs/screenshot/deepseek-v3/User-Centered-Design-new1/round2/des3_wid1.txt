Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle border (#e0e0e0). The main search input has a blue border (#007bff) that darkens on focus, creating clear visual feedback. Elements are sized for usability: 16px font for readability, 12px padding for comfortable clicking, and 600px max-width for optimal content display. The layout uses flexbox for responsive alignment, with filters arranged horizontally and recent searches displayed as rounded tags. These choices prioritize user experience through clear visual hierarchy, adequate spacing, and intuitive interaction patterns that guide users through the search process efficiently.

Question 2: This search widget appears prominently in the website's header or navigation bar, making it immediately accessible from any page. It's always visible to users, positioned as a primary navigation element. The widget may also appear in modal overlays on mobile devices or when users click a search icon in responsive designs. Its persistent presence ensures users can initiate product searches at any point during their browsing experience, supporting the ecommerce goal of helping customers quickly find what they're looking for without navigation barriers.

Question 3: Users can type search queries in the input field, with real-time suggestions potentially appearing. They can click the search button or press Enter to execute searches. The widget allows filtering by category, price range, and sorting preferences through dropdown menus. Recent search tags are clickable, enabling quick access to previous queries. All interactive elements provide visual feedback: buttons change color on hover, input borders highlight on focus, and tags respond to mouse interactions. The design supports keyboard navigation, allowing users to tab through all interactive elements sequentially for accessibility.
