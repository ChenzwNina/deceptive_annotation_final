Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a maximum width of 600px for optimal readability. The color scheme includes professional blues (#3498db) for primary actions, success green (#27ae60) for completed steps, and neutral grays for text and backgrounds. The timeline uses circular icons (32px) with clear visual indicators for different statuses. These design choices prioritize clarity, accessibility, and visual hierarchy - making it easy for users to quickly understand their order status while maintaining a professional e-commerce aesthetic.

Question 2: This widget appears when users access their order history or order confirmation page after making a purchase. It can also be triggered by clicking "Track Order" from order emails, account dashboard order lists, or by entering a tracking number in the website's tracking section. The widget loads automatically when users navigate to specific order details pages, providing immediate visibility into order status without additional user action.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by: 1) Viewing the visual timeline to understand current order status and progress, 2) Clicking the "Track Package" button to open carrier tracking in a new window, 3) Clicking "View Order Details" to see full order information and items, 4) Clicking "Need Help?" to access customer support options. The timeline itself is informational only, while the action buttons provide pathways to additional functionality and support resources.
