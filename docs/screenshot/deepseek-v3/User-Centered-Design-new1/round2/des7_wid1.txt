Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and subtle border. The large 4.5 average rating in golden yellow (#ffc107) immediately draws attention, while star ratings use the same golden color for visual consistency. The layout is organized hierarchically - average rating first, followed by star distribution bars, and ending with a prominent call-to-action button. I chose these colors for accessibility and emotional appeal (gold evokes quality), and the layout prioritizes the most important information (average rating) while providing detailed breakdowns for interested users. The widget is 400px wide for optimal readability on desktop and mobile.

    Question 2: This ratings widget appears automatically when users navigate to a product page on the ecommerce website. It's positioned prominently near the product description and images, typically in the right column or below the product details section. The widget loads immediately with the page content, providing instant social proof and helping users make informed purchase decisions. It remains visible throughout the product browsing experience and doesn't require any user action to display.

    Question 3: Users can interact with the widget in several ways: They can hover over stars to see tooltips, click on individual star ratings in the breakdown section to filter reviews by rating, click the "Write a Review" button to submit their own rating and review, and view the visual distribution of ratings through the progress bars. The widget also supports scrolling through individual reviews (if expanded) and clicking on reviewer profiles. All interactions provide immediate visual feedback through color changes and transitions to create a responsive, engaging experience.
