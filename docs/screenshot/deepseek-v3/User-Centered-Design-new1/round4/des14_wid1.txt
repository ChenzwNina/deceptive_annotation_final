Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a blue (#3498db) for active steps and green (#27ae60) for completed steps to create intuitive visual progression. The layout includes a centered header, horizontal progress tracker with circular indicators, and organized detail sections. I chose these colors for accessibility and clear status differentiation. The circular steps with connecting lines create an intuitive visual journey, while ample spacing and typography hierarchy ensure readability. The design prioritizes user comprehension of order status through color psychology and clear visual hierarchy.

Question 2: This widget appears when users access their order history from their account dashboard or click "Track Order" from order confirmation emails. It can also be triggered by entering an order number and tracking code on the website's tracking page. The widget loads automatically when customers view specific order details in their purchase history. Some ecommerce sites may also display it after checkout completion to provide immediate tracking information for new orders.

Question 3: Users can view their order progression through the visual timeline, check detailed shipping information, and see estimated delivery dates. They can copy tracking numbers by selecting text, though no explicit copy button is provided. The widget is primarily informational with limited interactive elements beyond viewing. In a full implementation, users might click tracking numbers to open carrier websites or expand/collapse sections for more details. The current design focuses on clear information presentation rather than complex interactions, making it accessible across all devices and user technical levels.
