Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a maximum width of 500px for optimal readability. Key elements include a prominent search input with a magnifying glass icon, category and price range dropdown filters, and clear primary/secondary action buttons. The color scheme uses blue (#4299e1) for primary actions and neutral grays for secondary elements, ensuring good contrast and accessibility. Typography is clean and legible with proper hierarchy. These design choices create an intuitive, professional interface that aligns with modern ecommerce standards while maintaining usability across devices.

    Question 2: The search panel widget typically appears when users click a search icon in the website header or navigation bar. It may also be triggered by keyboard shortcuts (like Ctrl+K or Cmd+K) or appear automatically when users land on product listing pages. Some implementations show the panel when users start typing on the homepage. The trigger is designed to be easily accessible but not intrusive, allowing users to initiate search when needed without cluttering the main interface.

    Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by typing search queries in the input field, which may trigger real-time suggestions. They can filter results by selecting categories and price ranges from dropdown menus. The clear filters button resets all selections, while the search button executes the query with applied filters. Users can close the panel using the X button in the top-right corner. The input field supports keyboard navigation, allowing users to press Enter to search or Escape to close. Advanced implementations may include auto-complete, search history, and recent searches for enhanced user experience.
