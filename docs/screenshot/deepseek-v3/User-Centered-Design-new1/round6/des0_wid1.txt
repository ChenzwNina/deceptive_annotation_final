Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background for product cards against a light gray section background. Cards use a responsive grid layout that adapts to screen size. I chose a blue primary color for buttons (#3498db) for trust and action, with red prices (#e74c3c) to attract attention. Cards have subtle shadows and hover effects for depth and interactivity. The layout uses ample white space and clear typography hierarchy for readability. These choices create a professional, trustworthy appearance that guides users' attention to key elements while maintaining visual appeal.

Question 2: This featured products widget appears automatically when users land on the homepage or main landing pages of the ecommerce website. It's designed to be a permanent section that's always visible to showcase curated or popular products. The widget loads immediately with the page content, requiring no user interaction to appear. It serves as a primary merchandising tool to highlight key products and drive conversions from the moment users enter the site.

Question 3: Users can hover over product cards to see elevation effects (lift and enhanced shadow). They can click "Add to Cart" buttons to add items directly to their shopping cart. The responsive grid layout allows users to view products optimally on any device size. Users can read product descriptions, see ratings and reviews, and compare prices across different featured items. While the current implementation doesn't include additional modals or detailed views, in a full implementation, users could click product images or names to navigate to detailed product pages for more information and additional purchase options.
