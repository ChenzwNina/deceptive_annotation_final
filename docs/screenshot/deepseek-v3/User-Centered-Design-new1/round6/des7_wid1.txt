Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and subtle shadow for depth. The large blue average rating (4.7) immediately draws attention, complemented by gold stars for visual appeal. Rating bars use green (#4CAF50) for positive association, with clear percentage labels. The layout is organized hierarchically - average rating first, then detailed breakdown, ending with a prominent call-to-action button. These choices prioritize readability, trust-building through color psychology, and intuitive information hierarchy to help users quickly assess product quality.

    Question 2: This ratings widget appears automatically when users view a product page on the ecommerce website. It's integrated into the product information section, typically displayed alongside product images, descriptions, and pricing. The widget loads simultaneously with other product details as part of the initial page render, providing immediate social proof and quality indicators to assist purchase decisions without requiring any user action to trigger its display.

    Question 3: Users can interact with the widget in several ways: They can visually scan the star distribution bars to understand rating patterns across different score levels. The "Write a Review" button is clickable, opening a review submission form when activated. While the displayed ratings themselves aren't interactive in this implementation, in an enhanced version users could potentially click on specific star ratings to filter reviews, or hover over elements for additional tooltips with detailed statistics about the rating distribution.
