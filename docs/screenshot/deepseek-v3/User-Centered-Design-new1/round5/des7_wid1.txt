Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and rounded corners for visual appeal. The large 4.7 average rating in blue (#2c5aa0) immediately draws attention, while gold stars (#ffc107) provide clear visual rating indicators. The layout uses a card-based design with proper spacing and hierarchy - average rating prominently displayed, followed by distribution bars showing rating breakdown, and sample reviews at the bottom. Green progress bars (#4CAF50) show positive ratings clearly. These choices create a professional, trustworthy appearance that's easy to scan and understand quickly.

    Question 2: This ratings widget would typically appear automatically when a user visits a product page on an ecommerce website. It's triggered by the page load event and displays alongside product images, descriptions, and pricing information. The widget loads as part of the initial page render, providing immediate social proof and customer feedback to help shoppers make informed purchasing decisions. In some implementations, it might also appear when users click a "See Reviews" button or tab.

    Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by scrolling through displayed reviews to read detailed customer feedback. They can analyze the rating distribution by examining the percentage bars for each star level. The widget may include pagination controls to navigate through multiple review pages. Some implementations allow users to sort reviews by date, rating, or helpfulness. Users might also be able to click "Write a Review" buttons to submit their own ratings, report inappropriate content, or mark reviews as helpful. The design supports both quick scanning of overall ratings and deep diving into individual customer experiences.
