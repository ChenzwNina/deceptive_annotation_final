Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadows for depth. It uses a maximum width of 600px for optimal readability. The color scheme includes professional blues (#3498db) for active elements, greens (#27ae60) for completed status, and neutral grays for text and backgrounds. The timeline uses a vertical layout with clear visual hierarchy - completed steps in green, active steps highlighted in blue with shadows, and pending steps in neutral colors. These design choices enhance usability by providing clear visual cues about order progress while maintaining a professional, trustworthy appearance that aligns with e-commerce best practices.

Question 2: This widget appears when a customer accesses their order history or clicks on a specific order from their account dashboard. It can also be triggered by clicking tracking links in order confirmation emails or by entering an order number in the website's tracking section. The widget loads with the specific order's tracking data pre-populated, showing the customer exactly where their package is in the delivery process without requiring additional searches or navigation.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by: 1) Viewing the complete order timeline with color-coded status indicators, 2) Clicking action buttons to view full order details, contact customer support, or download invoices, 3) Hovering over timeline steps for additional details (tooltips could show more specific timestamps), 4) Expanding/collapsing the shipping details section, and 5) Clicking tracking numbers to open carrier tracking pages in new tabs. The buttons feature hover effects with subtle animations for better user feedback, and the entire widget is responsive for mobile interaction.
