Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a centered title "Featured Products" in dark blue (#2c3e50). Products are displayed in a responsive grid with white cards featuring subtle shadows and rounded corners. Each card includes a product image (200px height), star ratings in gold, product name in dark blue, description in gray, price in red, and a blue "Add to Cart" button. The design uses a professional color palette with sufficient white space for readability. Cards feature hover effects (lift and enhanced shadow) for better interactivity. These choices create an attractive, user-friendly interface that emphasizes products while maintaining visual hierarchy and encouraging conversions.

Question 2: This featured products widget appears automatically when users land on the homepage or main product category pages. It's typically triggered by page load as part of the initial page rendering. The component is designed to be a permanent fixture on these key landing pages to showcase popular or promoted items. It doesn't require any specific user action to appear but serves as a strategic placement to highlight products the ecommerce platform wants to feature prominently to all visitors.

Question 3: Users can hover over product cards to see a lift animation and enhanced shadow effect. They can click the "Add to Cart" button to add items directly to their shopping cart. Clicking anywhere on the product card could navigate to the product detail page for more information. The grid layout is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. Users can scroll through the products horizontally on mobile if space is constrained. The component supports browsing multiple featured items quickly and making immediate purchase decisions without leaving the current page context.
