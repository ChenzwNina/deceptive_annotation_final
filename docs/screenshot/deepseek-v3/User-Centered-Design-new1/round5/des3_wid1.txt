Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle gray borders (#e0e0e0). It uses a 600px max-width container with rounded corners (8px border-radius) and a soft shadow for depth. The search input is prominently sized with 12px padding, while buttons and filters use consistent 4px border-radius. Blue (#007bff) is used for the primary search button with hover states. This design prioritizes usability with clear visual hierarchy, adequate spacing, and accessible contrast ratios to ensure easy navigation and readability across devices.

    Question 2: The search widget appears automatically when users land on the ecommerce website's homepage or product listing pages. It can also be triggered by clicking a search icon in the navigation header, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K), or when users scroll to the top of product pages. The widget remains persistently visible in key locations where users expect search functionality, ensuring immediate access without requiring additional clicks to initiate product discovery.

    Question 3: Users can type search queries in the input field and submit via Enter key or the search button. They can filter results by category, price range, and sort options using dropdown menus. Recent search tags are clickable to quickly repeat previous searches. The input field supports auto-suggestions as users type. All interactive elements include hover states and focus indicators for keyboard navigation. Form submissions trigger search results page navigation with applied filters, while maintaining the search state for refinement.
