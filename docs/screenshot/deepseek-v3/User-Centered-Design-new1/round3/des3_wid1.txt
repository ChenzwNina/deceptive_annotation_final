Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a blue color scheme (#3498db) for primary actions, creating visual hierarchy. The 320px width ensures it's substantial yet non-intrusive. Input fields have 12px padding for comfortable interaction, and rounded corners (6-8px) provide a friendly aesthetic. These choices prioritize usability - sufficient contrast for readability, adequate sizing for touch targets, and a professional color palette that aligns with ecommerce trustworthiness.

Question 2: The widget appears when users click the floating circular search button (🔍) positioned at the top-right corner of the screen. This trigger button remains persistently visible, ensuring search functionality is always accessible. The widget can be dismissed by clicking the close button (×), clicking the trigger button again, or clicking outside the widget area. This multi-modal dismissal approach provides flexible user control over the widget's visibility state.

Question 3: Users can: 1) Type search queries in the text input field, 2) Filter by category using the dropdown (Electronics, Clothing, etc.), 3) Filter by price range through another dropdown, 4) Execute searches by clicking the search button or pressing Enter, 5) Close the widget via multiple methods. The interface provides real-time visual feedback - input borders highlight on focus, buttons change color on hover, and the widget smoothly appears/disappears. All interactions are designed to be intuitive and efficient for product discovery.
