Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a blue progress bar (#3498db) to indicate current status, with green (#27ae60) for completed steps. The layout is organized hierarchically: order header, visual progress tracker, detailed information section, and action buttons. I chose these colors for accessibility and emotional resonance - blue conveys trust, green indicates success. The 600px max-width ensures readability on all devices, while the card-based design with rounded corners and adequate spacing creates a professional, user-friendly interface.

Question 2: This widget appears when a customer accesses their order history or receives a tracking notification. It can be triggered by clicking "Track Order" from the order confirmation email, accessing the order through their account dashboard, or entering a tracking number on the website's tracking page. The widget loads dynamically with the specific order data, providing real-time tracking information without requiring page refresh.

Question 3: Users can view their order progress through the visual timeline, check detailed shipping information, and interact with action buttons. They can click "Track Package" to open the carrier's tracking page in a new tab, or "View Order Details" to see the complete order summary. The widget also supports responsive design interactions - it adapts to different screen sizes. While the current progress is automatically updated, users can refresh the page to get the latest status updates from the shipping carrier's API.
