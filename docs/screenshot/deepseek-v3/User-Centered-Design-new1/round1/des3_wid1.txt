Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle gray borders (#e0e0e0). It uses a soft shadow for depth and rounded corners (8px radius) for a friendly appearance. The primary blue button (#007bff) provides clear call-to-action. Elements are sized for readability: 18px title, 14px body text, and comfortable padding (20px container, 12px inputs). This design prioritizes usability with clear visual hierarchy, sufficient spacing, and accessible color contrast to ensure easy navigation and reduce cognitive load.

Question 2: The search widget appears when users click the search icon/magnifying glass typically located in the website header. It can also be triggered by keyboard shortcuts (like Ctrl+K or Cmd+K) for power users. On mobile devices, it might appear as a persistent search bar or slide-in panel when the search icon is tapped. The widget overlays content to maintain focus on search functionality while remaining easily dismissible via the close button or clicking outside the panel.

Question 3: Users can: 1) Type search queries in the input field with real-time suggestions, 2) Execute searches by clicking the search button or pressing Enter, 3) Filter results by category and price range using dropdown menus, 4) Click recent search terms for quick access, 5) Close the panel using the X button, 6) Clear search input manually, and 7) Navigate between form fields using Tab key. The interface supports both mouse and keyboard interactions for accessibility.
