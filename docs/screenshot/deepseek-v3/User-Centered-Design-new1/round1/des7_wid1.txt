Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and subtle border. Key elements include a prominent 4.5 average rating in large, bold text (2.5rem), gold stars for visual appeal, and green progress bars showing rating distribution. The layout is organized hierarchically with clear visual separation between sections. These design choices prioritize readability and trust-building - the large rating immediately captures attention, while the detailed breakdown provides transparency. The color scheme is professional yet warm, and the card-style container with shadow creates visual distinction without being overwhelming.

    Question 2: This ratings widget appears automatically when users view a product page on the ecommerce website. It's triggered by page load and is displayed as part of the product information section, typically below the product description and specifications. The widget loads immediately with the page content to provide social proof and help users make informed purchasing decisions. It remains visible throughout the product browsing experience and updates dynamically if new reviews are submitted while the page is open.

    Question 3: Users can interact with the widget in several ways: They can read individual user reviews displayed in the list, click the "Load More Reviews" button to see additional ratings, and hover over elements for subtle visual feedback. The rating distribution bars provide quick visual understanding of how other customers rated the product. Users can also scroll through the reviews section if it exceeds the initial display height. While this particular widget doesn't include submission functionality, in a full implementation users could typically click to submit their own ratings or report inappropriate reviews through additional interactive elements.
