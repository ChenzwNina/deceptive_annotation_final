Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a centered title and responsive grid layout. Product cards use white backgrounds with subtle shadows for depth, blue primary buttons for clear CTAs, and a professional color palette of blues, grays, and accent colors. Cards have hover effects with lift animations to enhance interactivity. Text sizes are hierarchical with clear typography for readability. These choices create an aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly interface that guides attention to products while maintaining professional credibility.

    Question 2: This featured products widget appears automatically when users land on the homepage or main product category pages. It serves as a permanent section showcasing curated products, unlike pop-ups that appear based on user behavior. The widget is always visible in its designated section to highlight special offers, best-sellers, or new arrivals without requiring specific triggers, ensuring maximum visibility for promoted items.

    Question 3: Users can hover over product cards to see lift animations and shadow enhancements. They can click "Add to Cart" buttons to add items directly to their shopping cart. Clicking anywhere on the product card could navigate to the product detail page for more information. The responsive grid adapts to different screen sizes, and users can scroll through multiple products. Future enhancements could include quick view modals, wishlist icons, and social sharing options for expanded interaction capabilities.
