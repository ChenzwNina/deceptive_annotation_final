Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadow for depth. Key elements include a progress bar with gradient colors (blue to green) showing order status, circular step indicators (32px diameter) with color coding (gray for pending, blue for active, green for completed), and organized typography hierarchy. The layout uses ample spacing (20-25px margins) and a card-based structure for clarity. These design choices enhance readability, provide visual hierarchy, and use color psychology (green for completion, blue for progress) to intuitively communicate order status while maintaining professional aesthetics suitable for e-commerce.

Question 2: The widget appears when users access their order history page or click "Track Order" from their account dashboard. It can also be triggered by clicking tracking links in order confirmation emails or order status notifications. Some implementations may display it automatically after purchase completion or when users return to the site with pending orders. The trigger is typically user-initiated through account navigation or system-generated notifications related to their purchase journey.

Question 3: Users can view comprehensive order details including progress visualization, estimated delivery date, carrier information, and tracking number. Interactive elements include hovering over progress steps for additional details, clicking action buttons ("Track Package" opens carrier tracking, "View Order Details" shows full order summary), and potentially expanding/collapsing sections for more information. The design supports responsive interactions across devices and may include real-time updates through background API calls. The widget serves as both an information display and navigation hub to related order management features.
