Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadows for depth. Key elements include a centered header with dark gray text (#2c3e50), form inputs with light gray borders (#e0e0e0) that turn blue (#3498db) on focus, and two membership option cards in a grid layout. The submit button uses a blue gradient (#3498db to #2980b9) with hover effects. I chose these colors for professionalism and accessibility - high contrast ensures readability while the blue accent creates visual hierarchy. The 450px max-width provides optimal reading comfort on all devices, and rounded corners (8-12px) create a friendly, approachable feel.

    Question 2: This membership signup widget would typically appear in multiple contexts: as a popup/modal when users visit the website for the first time, after adding items to their cart to encourage membership benefits, on the checkout page as an upsell opportunity, or as a persistent section on the homepage/landing pages. It could also be triggered when users click "Join Membership" links in the navigation menu or when they attempt to access member-exclusive content without an active subscription.

    Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by: 1) Entering their full name and email in text fields with real-time validation, 2) Clicking to select between Basic or Premium membership plans (visual feedback shows selection), 3) Checking the terms agreement checkbox (required for submission), 4) Clicking the submit button which shows loading state and success message, and 5) Clicking links to view Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (would open in new tabs). The form provides immediate visual feedback - input borders change color on focus, buttons have hover effects, and invalid submissions are prevented until all required fields are properly completed.
