Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle gray borders (#e0e0e0). It uses a soft shadow for depth and rounded corners (8px radius) for a friendly appearance. The main search input is prominently sized with 12px padding, while filter buttons are smaller with 8px padding and rounded pill shapes. The primary button uses blue (#007bff) for clear call-to-action. This design prioritizes usability with adequate spacing, clear visual hierarchy, and responsive elements that work well on various screen sizes. The color scheme ensures good contrast and readability while maintaining a professional ecommerce aesthetic.

Question 2: This search panel widget would typically appear when users click on a search icon or press a designated keyboard shortcut (like Ctrl+K or Cmd+K) commonly found in ecommerce website headers. It could also be triggered programmatically based on user behavior, such as when they land on a category page or when no search results are found. The widget is designed to overlay existing content, providing a focused search experience without navigating away from the current page.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by: 1) Typing search queries in the main input field, 2) Clicking the search button or pressing Enter to execute searches, 3) Selecting category filters by clicking toggle buttons that highlight when active, 4) Choosing price range filters for refined results, 5) Clicking recent search tags to quickly populate the search field, and 6) Closing the panel using the X button. The input field also supports keyboard navigation and the Enter key for quick searching. All interactive elements provide visual feedback through hover states and active states.
