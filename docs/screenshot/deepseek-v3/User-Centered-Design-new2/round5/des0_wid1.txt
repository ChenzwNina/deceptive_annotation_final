Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and blue accent colors (#3498db). Product cards have subtle shadows and rounded corners (12px radius) for a contemporary look. The grid layout uses auto-fit with minimum 280px columns for responsive design. Typography uses a clear hierarchy: section title (2.5rem), product names (1.3rem), and descriptive text (0.95rem). These choices enhance readability, create visual hierarchy, and provide a professional e-commerce appearance that builds trust while maintaining aesthetic appeal.

    Question 2: This featured products widget appears automatically when users land on the homepage or main product category pages. It's designed to be a permanent section of these key pages, immediately visible without requiring any user action. The widget loads with the page content as part of the initial render, positioned prominently to capture user attention and drive engagement with highlighted products from the moment visitors arrive at the site.

    Question 3: Users can hover over product cards to see elevation effects (cards lift up with enhanced shadows). They can click "Add to Cart" buttons to immediately add items to their shopping cart. Clicking anywhere on the product card could navigate to the full product detail page. The responsive grid adapts to different screen sizes, and users can scroll through multiple products. Visual feedback includes button hover states and smooth transitions for all interactive elements, creating an engaging shopping experience.
