Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadow for depth. The search input is large (600px max-width) with comfortable padding and a 16px font size for readability. Primary blue (#007bff) is used for the search button to draw attention, with filter dropdowns in light gray (#f8f9fa). The layout is organized with clear visual hierarchy: search bar first, followed by filters, then recent searches. These choices prioritize usability - high contrast for important elements, adequate spacing to prevent crowding, and intuitive grouping of related functions.

    Question 2: The search widget appears prominently on the ecommerce website's header or main navigation area, making it immediately accessible from any page. It's always visible to users, positioned as a persistent element in the site's layout. Additionally, it may appear as a modal overlay when users click a search icon on mobile devices, adapting to different screen sizes while maintaining functionality across all device types.

    Question 3: Users can type search queries in the input field, click the search button or press Enter to execute searches. They can filter results by category, price range, and sorting preferences using dropdown menus. Recent search tags are clickable to quickly repeat previous searches. The input field provides real-time feedback with focus states, and the search button has hover effects. All interactions are designed to be intuitive and efficient, minimizing the number of clicks needed to find products while providing multiple pathways to refine search results.
