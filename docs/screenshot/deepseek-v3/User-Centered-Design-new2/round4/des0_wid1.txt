Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a centered header, responsive grid layout, and card-based product displays. Colors include professional blues and grays for headers, with accent colors for buttons and prices. Cards have subtle shadows and hover effects for depth. Product images are uniformly sized at 200px height. This design creates visual hierarchy, ensures consistency, and provides excellent readability while maintaining a premium feel that encourages user engagement.

Question 2: This featured products widget appears automatically when users land on the homepage or main product categories page. It's designed to be immediately visible without any user interaction required, serving as a primary content section that showcases curated products to drive sales and highlight popular or seasonal items.

Question 3: Users can hover over product cards to see elevation effects, click product cards to view detailed product pages, click "Add to Cart" buttons to add items directly to their shopping cart, and browse through multiple featured products in the responsive grid. The layout adapts to different screen sizes, and users can scroll through the entire product collection if more items are available beyond the initial view.
