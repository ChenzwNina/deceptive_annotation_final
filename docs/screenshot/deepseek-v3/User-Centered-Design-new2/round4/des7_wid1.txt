Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and subtle shadow for depth. The average rating (4.5) is prominently displayed in large blue text (2.5rem) to draw attention. Gold stars (#ffc107) provide visual rating indicators. The layout uses a card-based design with rounded corners (8px radius) and adequate spacing (20px padding). Color choices create good contrast for readability while maintaining a professional e-commerce aesthetic. The bar chart visualization helps users quickly understand rating distribution patterns.

    Question 2: This ratings widget appears automatically when users view product pages on the e-commerce website. It's triggered by page load and is displayed as part of the product information section, typically alongside product images, descriptions, and pricing details. The widget loads immediately with the rest of the page content to provide social proof and help users make informed purchasing decisions based on previous customer experiences.

    Question 3: Users can view the overall average rating and detailed rating distribution through the visual bar chart. They can read individual review counts for each star rating level. The primary interaction is clicking the "Write a Review" button, which would typically open a review submission form. In a full implementation, users could also click on individual rating bars to filter reviews by star rating, or click the average rating to scroll to the detailed reviews section. The widget provides both quick overview and detailed analysis capabilities.
