Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a blue progress bar (#3498db) to indicate current status, with green (#27ae60) for completed steps. The layout is organized hierarchically: order header, visual progress tracker, detailed information section, and action buttons. I chose these colors for accessibility and visual hierarchy - blue for active elements, green for completion, and neutral grays for text. The 600px max-width ensures readability while the 25px padding provides comfortable spacing. The circular step icons and progress bar create an intuitive visual timeline.

    Question 2: This widget appears when a customer accesses their order history or receives an order confirmation email with a tracking link. It can also be triggered by clicking "Track Order" from the user's account dashboard or by entering an order number and email on the tracking page. The widget typically loads after authentication or order lookup, displaying real-time shipping progress and delivery estimates.

    Question 3: Users can interact with the widget in several ways: viewing the visual progress of their order through the timeline, reading detailed shipping information, clicking the "Track Package" button to open the carrier's tracking page in a new tab, and selecting "View Order Details" to see the complete order summary. The progress bar provides passive information while the buttons enable active navigation. Hover effects on buttons provide visual feedback, and the responsive design ensures usability across different devices.
