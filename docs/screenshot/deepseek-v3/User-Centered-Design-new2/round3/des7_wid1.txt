Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and subtle border. Key elements include a large blue average rating (4.7), gold stars for visual appeal, and green progress bars showing rating distribution. The layout is organized hierarchically with clear visual separation between sections. These design choices prioritize readability and trust-building - the prominent rating immediately captures attention, while the detailed breakdown provides transparency. The color scheme uses professional, accessible colors that convey reliability and positive sentiment.

    Question 2: This ratings widget appears automatically when users navigate to a product page on the ecommerce website. It's triggered by the page load event and displays immediately as part of the product information section. The widget is always visible to provide potential buyers with social proof and quality indicators before making purchase decisions. It may also appear in search results or product listings as a condensed version, expanding to full view when users click through to individual product pages.

    Question 3: Users can interact with the widget in several ways: They can read detailed reviews in the recent reviews section, click the "Write a Review" button to submit their own rating and feedback, and potentially filter reviews by star rating (though this functionality would require additional implementation). The widget may also support hovering over rating bars to see exact percentages, and clicking on individual reviews could expand them for full reading. These interactions help users make informed decisions and contribute to the community feedback system.
