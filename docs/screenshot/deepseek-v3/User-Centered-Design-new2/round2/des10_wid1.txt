Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white card layout on a light gray background. I used a blue gradient (#3498db to #2980b9) for the primary button to create visual hierarchy and encourage action. The form uses ample white space, rounded corners (8-12px), and subtle shadows for depth. Text colors progress from dark gray (#2c3e50) for headings to medium gray (#7f8c8d) for supporting text. These choices create a professional, trustworthy appearance while ensuring excellent readability and accessibility. The responsive design adapts to mobile screens with adjusted padding and font sizes.

Question 2: This membership signup widget would typically appear when users click a "Join Membership" or "Sign Up" button in the website's navigation, footer, or on dedicated landing pages. It could also be triggered as a pop-up modal after users browse certain premium product categories or when they attempt to access member-exclusive content. The widget might appear as an exit-intent popup when users show signs of leaving the site without signing up.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by: 1) Entering their email and password in the form fields with real-time validation, 2) Selecting membership options by clicking radio buttons or the entire option card, which provides visual feedback through border color changes and background highlighting, 3) Reading and agreeing to terms via checkbox, 4) Submitting the form with a prominent CTA button that shows loading states and success confirmation. The form includes hover effects, focus states for accessibility, and responsive behavior across devices.
