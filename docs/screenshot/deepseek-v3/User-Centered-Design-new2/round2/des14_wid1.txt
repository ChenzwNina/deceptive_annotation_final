Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a maximum width of 600px for optimal readability. The color scheme employs green (#48bb78) for completed steps, blue (#4299e1) for current status, and neutral grays for text hierarchy. Icons are circular (40px) with clear visual states. These choices enhance usability: high contrast ensures readability, color coding provides instant status recognition, and consistent spacing creates visual harmony while maintaining professional aesthetics suitable for e-commerce.

Question 2: The widget appears when users access their order history page or click "Track Order" from their account dashboard, order confirmation email, or shipping notification. It can also be triggered by entering an order number in a tracking search field. The appearance is contextual - showing only when users actively seek tracking information to avoid cluttering the interface and maintain relevance to the user's current task.

Question 3: Users can visually scan the progress bar and timeline steps to understand order status. They can click action buttons: "Track Package" opens detailed carrier tracking, "View Order Details" shows the complete order, and "Need Help?" accesses support. The timeline is informational-only, showing dates and descriptions. Hover effects on buttons provide interactive feedback. The design supports both quick status checks and deeper engagement through the action buttons, catering to different user needs from basic tracking to detailed inquiry.
