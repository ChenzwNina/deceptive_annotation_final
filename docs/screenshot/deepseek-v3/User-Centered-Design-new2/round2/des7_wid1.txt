Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and blue accent color (#2c5aa0) for the average rating and progress bars. It uses a card-like layout with rounded corners and subtle shadows for depth. The large 4.7 average rating immediately captures attention, while the star distribution bars provide quick visual insights. I chose these colors for professionalism and readability, with sufficient contrast for accessibility. The layout prioritizes the most important information (average rating) while maintaining a clean hierarchy.

Question 2: This ratings widget typically appears automatically when users navigate to a product page on an ecommerce website. It's triggered by the page load and displays the aggregated ratings and reviews for that specific product. Some implementations might also show the widget when users click a "See Reviews" button or scroll to the reviews section. The widget loads with the product information and remains visible throughout the user's interaction with the product page.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by: 1) Reading individual reviews in the user reviews section, 2) Viewing the star distribution breakdown to understand rating patterns, 3) Potentially filtering reviews by star rating (if implemented), 4) Scrolling through multiple reviews if more are available, and 5) In some implementations, clicking to expand collapsed reviews or sort reviews by date, rating, or helpfulness. The widget may also include options for users to report inappropriate reviews or mark reviews as helpful.
