Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle border (#e0e0e0) for contrast. It uses a soft shadow for depth and rounded corners (8px radius) for approachability. The search input has a prominent blue border (#007bff) to draw attention, with adequate padding (12px) for comfortable typing. Filter sections use smaller fonts (14px) to maintain hierarchy. The layout is organized vertically with clear spacing between elements, ensuring intuitive navigation. These choices prioritize usability with sufficient contrast, appropriate sizing for touch targets, and a professional aesthetic that builds trust.

    Question 2: The search panel appears when users click on the search icon typically located in the website header. It can also be triggered by keyboard shortcuts (like Ctrl+K) or voice commands if supported. On mobile devices, it might appear as a full-screen overlay when the search icon in the navigation menu is tapped. The panel is designed to be modal, temporarily taking focus to help users concentrate on their search task without distractions from the main page content.

    Question 3: Users can type search queries in the input field, which supports real-time suggestions. They can filter results by category and price range using dropdown menus. The search button executes the query with applied filters. Recent search tags allow quick access to previous queries. The close button dismisses the panel. Keyboard navigation includes Tab to move between elements, Enter to search, and Escape to close. The interface also supports screen readers with proper ARIA labels and focus management for accessibility.
