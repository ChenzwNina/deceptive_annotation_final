Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a centered title and responsive grid layout. Product cards have white backgrounds with subtle shadows, rounded corners, and hover effects for visual feedback. I used a blue primary color (#3498db) for buttons and accents, with complementary grays for text. Product images are consistently sized at 200px height. Prices are highlighted in red (#e74c3c) to draw attention. These choices create visual hierarchy, ensure readability, and provide intuitive interaction cues while maintaining a professional e-commerce appearance.

Question 2: This featured products widget appears automatically when users land on the homepage or main landing page of the ecommerce website. It's designed to be immediately visible without requiring any user action to trigger its display. The widget loads as part of the initial page render, positioned prominently to showcase key products and drive engagement from the moment visitors arrive on the site.

Question 3: Users can hover over product cards to see elevation and shadow effects. They can click "Add to Cart" buttons to immediately add products to their shopping cart. The "View All Featured Products" button allows users to navigate to a dedicated featured products page. Product cards are clickable (though not implemented here, typically would link to product detail pages). The grid layout is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. Hover states provide visual feedback for all interactive elements, creating an intuitive and engaging shopping experience.
