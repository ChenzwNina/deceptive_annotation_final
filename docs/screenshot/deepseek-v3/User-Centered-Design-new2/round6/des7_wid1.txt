Question 1: The widget features a clean, professional design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and blue accent color (#2c5aa0) for brand consistency. The layout includes a prominent average rating display (2.5rem size), visual star ratings, percentage bars showing rating distribution, and individual user reviews. I chose a card-based design with subtle shadows and rounded corners for modern appeal. The color scheme uses blues for trust and professionalism, with sufficient white space for readability. Element sizes are optimized for quick scanning - large numbers for key metrics, smaller text for details.

Question 2: This ratings widget appears automatically when users navigate to a product page in the ecommerce website. It's triggered by the page load event and displays immediately as part of the product information section. The widget loads alongside other product details like images, description, and pricing. It remains visible throughout the user's product page visit to provide continuous access to social proof and customer feedback.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by: 1) Reading individual reviews with user details and dates, 2) Voting on review helpfulness using "Helpful/Not Helpful" buttons, 3) Viewing the rating distribution through visual percentage bars, 4) Scanning star ratings for quick quality assessment. The buttons provide immediate feedback when clicked, and the layout allows easy scanning of multiple reviews. Users can also potentially sort or filter reviews (though not implemented here) and report inappropriate content.
