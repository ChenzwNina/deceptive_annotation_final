Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a maximum width of 600px for optimal readability. The color scheme employs #2c3e50 for primary text, #7f8c8d for secondary text, and status colors: green (#27ae60) for completed steps, blue (#3498db) for active steps. I chose these colors for excellent contrast and accessibility. The timeline uses circular icons (40px) with clear visual states: completed (green check), active (blue dot), and pending (gray circle). The layout is vertically structured with adequate spacing (20-25px margins) to create visual hierarchy and prevent information overload. These design choices prioritize clarity, scannability, and intuitive understanding of order progression.

Question 2: This widget appears automatically when a customer views their order details page after placing an order. It can also be triggered when customers click "Track Order" from their account dashboard, order confirmation emails, or shipping notification emails. The widget loads immediately with the page content, providing real-time tracking information without requiring additional user actions to initiate display. It remains accessible throughout the order fulfillment process until delivery is confirmed.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by: 1) Scanning the visual timeline to understand order progression stages. 2) Clicking the "Track Package" button to open carrier tracking in a new window. 3) Clicking "View Order Details" to see the complete order information. 4) Clicking "Need Help?" to access customer support options. The widget also displays hover effects on buttons for better interactivity feedback. While the main timeline is informational, the action buttons provide pathways to additional functionality and support resources, creating a comprehensive tracking experience.
