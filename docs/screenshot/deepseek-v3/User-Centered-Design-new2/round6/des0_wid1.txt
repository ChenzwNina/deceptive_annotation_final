Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a centered title and responsive grid layout. Cards have white backgrounds with subtle shadows, creating depth. Product images are 200px tall with consistent aspect ratios. Typography uses a clear hierarchy: section title (2rem), product names (1.2rem), and prices in red to attract attention. The color scheme combines professional blues and grays with accent colors for CTAs. These choices enhance readability, create visual appeal, and guide users' attention to key elements while maintaining a professional e-commerce appearance.

Question 2: This featured products widget appears automatically when users land on the homepage or main product category pages. It's a permanent section designed to showcase popular or promoted items without requiring user interaction to trigger its display. The widget loads with the page content as part of the initial render, ensuring immediate visibility to all visitors. It serves as a curated collection that helps users discover products they might be interested in without needing to search or navigate through categories.

Question 3: Users can hover over product cards to see elevation effects (lift and enhanced shadow). They can click "Add to Cart" buttons to add items directly to their shopping cart. The entire product card is visually interactive, with hover states providing feedback. On mobile devices, touch interactions replace hover effects. The responsive grid adapts to different screen sizes, allowing comfortable interaction across devices. Users can also click product images or names (if linked to product pages) for more detailed information, though this specific implementation focuses on the quick-add functionality.
