Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#ffffff) and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a blue color scheme (#3498db) for primary elements and green (#27ae60) for completed statuses. The timeline uses colored dots and connecting lines to visualize progress. Font sizes range from 14px for details to 18px for headers, ensuring readability. The layout is organized with clear visual hierarchy, using spacing and borders to separate sections. These design choices prioritize clarity, scannability, and visual appeal while maintaining professional aesthetics suitable for e-commerce.

Question 2: The widget appears when users access their order history or click "Track Order" from order confirmation emails, account dashboards, or order confirmation pages. It can also be triggered by entering an order number and email in a tracking lookup form. Some implementations may show it automatically after purchase completion or when users return to the site with active orders. The appearance is typically initiated by user action seeking order status information.

Question 3: Users can view the complete order timeline with status updates, dates, and locations. They can interact with action buttons to view detailed order information, contact customer support, or track another order. The widget may include expandable sections for additional details like shipping carrier information or package contents. Some implementations allow users to set delivery preferences, request delivery changes, or provide delivery instructions. The design supports both quick status checks and detailed order management.
