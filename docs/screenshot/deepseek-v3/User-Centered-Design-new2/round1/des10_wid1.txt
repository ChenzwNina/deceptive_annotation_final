Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white card layout on a light gray background. It uses a professional color palette: blue primary buttons (#3498db), dark gray text (#2c3e50), and green pricing (#27ae60). Elements are sized for readability - 24px heading, 16px body text, and comfortable 12px input padding. The layout is centered with clear visual hierarchy, rounded corners for approachability, and subtle shadows for depth. These choices create a trustworthy, user-friendly experience that aligns with ecommerce best practices while maintaining visual appeal.

Question 2: This membership widget would typically appear when users first visit the website as a modal overlay, when they attempt to make a purchase without an account, or when they click a "Join Membership" link in the navigation. It could also trigger after a user has browsed multiple products or spent significant time on the site, using behavioral analytics to target engaged visitors. The appearance timing is strategic to capture interest while providing clear value proposition.

Question 3: Users can interact by entering their email and password with real-time validation that shows errors immediately. They can click to select between Basic and Premium membership plans, with visual feedback showing the selected option. The submit button processes the form with loading states and success confirmation. All form fields include hover and focus states for better UX. Invalid inputs display specific error messages, and the entire form can be reset upon successful submission, ready for the next user.
