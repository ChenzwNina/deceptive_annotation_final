Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and subtle shadow for depth. The average rating (4.7) is prominently displayed in large blue text (32px) to immediately capture attention. Gold stars (#ffc107) provide visual appeal and universal recognition. Rating bars use green (#4caf50) for positive associations, with clear percentage labels. The layout is organized hierarchically: average rating first, followed by distribution bars, then individual reviews. This design prioritizes readability and trust-building through professional aesthetics and clear information hierarchy.

Question 2: This ratings widget typically appears automatically when users view product pages on an ecommerce website. It's triggered by page load and displays alongside product images, descriptions, and pricing information. The widget serves as social proof to help customers make informed purchasing decisions. It may also appear in search results, category pages, or as a pop-up after purchase to encourage users to leave their own ratings. The timing ensures customers see authentic feedback when evaluating products.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by scrolling through individual reviews to read detailed feedback. They can analyze the rating distribution bars to understand overall satisfaction patterns. On some implementations, users can filter reviews by star rating or sort by date/relevance. They may also click to expand collapsed reviews or navigate through multiple pages of feedback. The most important interaction is the ability to submit their own rating and review, typically accessed via a "Write a Review" button that opens a submission form.
