Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a centered title and responsive grid layout. Product cards use white backgrounds with subtle shadows for depth, blue primary buttons for clear CTAs, and a professional color palette (blues, reds for prices). Cards are 280px minimum width with 30px gaps, ensuring good readability and touch targets. Hover effects provide interactive feedback. These choices prioritize usability, visual hierarchy, and mobile responsiveness while maintaining brand consistency.

Question 2: This featured products widget appears automatically when users land on the homepage or main product category pages. It can also be triggered by user actions like completing a search, browsing specific categories, or returning to the site after inactivity. The widget serves as a curated showcase of popular or promotional items to drive engagement and sales.

Question 3: Users can hover over product cards to see elevation effects, click product images/names to view detailed product pages, read customer ratings, add items directly to cart via "Add to Cart" buttons, and scroll horizontally on mobile. The grid layout adapts to different screen sizes, and all interactive elements provide visual feedback. Users can also navigate between multiple featured product sections if paginated.
