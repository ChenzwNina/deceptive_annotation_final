Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a modal dialog box centered horizontally and positioned near the top of the screen, with a semi-transparent dark overlay dimming the background page. The modal itself is white with soft, rounded corners and a subtle box-shadow, giving it a clean, modern look. The headline is large and bold to command attention.

I used a professional and trustworthy color palette. The primary “Keep My Benefits” button is a vibrant blue to make it the most attractive and positive choice. Conversely, the destructive “Yes, Cancel Membership” button is styled as a less prominent secondary action with red text on a transparent background, a common UX pattern to de-emphasize a negative outcome. A checklist with blue checkmarks reinforces the value of the benefits being lost. This entire layout and color scheme is a deliberate retention strategy, designed to focus the user's attention, clearly communicate the consequences of cancellation, and gently persuade them to reconsider.

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is triggered by a direct and intentional user action. It would not appear unexpectedly. The user would first need to navigate to their personal account section on the e-commerce website, find the page related to their membership status (e.g., "My Membership" or "Subscriptions"), and then click on a specific link or button labeled "Cancel Membership" or "Manage Subscription". This modal then serves as a crucial confirmation and retention step before the cancellation is finalized, ensuring the user is fully aware of their decision and giving the business one last chance to retain them.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have several clear interaction paths with this widget:

1.  **Keep Membership:** The user can click the primary blue "Keep My Benefits" button. This is the main retention path, which would close the modal and abort the cancellation process, returning them to their account page.

2.  **Confirm Cancellation:** The user can click the secondary "Yes, Cancel Membership" button. This would proceed with the cancellation, likely leading to a final confirmation page or an immediate update of their membership status.

3.  **Provide Feedback:** The user can optionally click into the text area and type a reason for their cancellation. This is not required to proceed but provides valuable data for the business.

4.  **Close the Modal:** The user can click the '×' icon in the top-right corner or click on the dark overlay area outside the modal. Both actions are considered a passive way of cancelling the cancellation process and would close the widget, just like clicking "Keep My Benefits".
