Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The widget is a clean, rectangular card with rounded corners and a subtle shadow, making it float above the main page content. It's centrally positioned at the top of the viewport. The color palette is professional and minimalist, using a white background, shades of grey for text, and a vibrant blue (#007bff) as the primary accent color to highlight progress and key information.

    The layout has a clear hierarchy. A header contains the large order number and estimated delivery date. Below this is a visual progress bar with four steps, where completed steps are filled with blue and show a checkmark, the active step has a prominent blue border, and future steps are grey. Finally, a detailed, reverse-chronological list of tracking updates provides specifics.

    These design choices are made to be intuitive and trustworthy. The visual progress bar gives users an immediate understanding of their order status. The clean layout and professional color scheme reduce cognitive load and build user confidence, which is crucial for an e-commerce experience.

    Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

    The most common and user-friendly trigger for this widget would be a direct user action. For instance, after a purchase, the user might receive a confirmation email with a "Track Your Order" button. Clicking this link would take them to the website, where this tracking widget would appear as an overlay.

    Alternatively, a logged-in user could navigate to their "Order History" or "My Account" page on the website and click a "Track" button next to a specific order. This action would then display the widget. While it could be triggered automatically upon a status change (e.g., when an item ships), making it user-initiated respects the user's current browsing context and avoids being intrusive. This approach ensures the information is presented precisely when the user is seeking it.

    Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    User interactions with this widget are designed to be simple and informational, avoiding complexity. The primary interactions are:

    1.  **Viewing:** The main purpose is to view information. Users can quickly glance at the progress bar for a high-level status update or read the "Tracking History" list for detailed, timestamped events.

    2.  **Copying Text:** Users can highlight and copy the tracking number (e.g., "1Z999AA10123456789") to paste it into the carrier's official tracking website for even more detailed information if they wish.

    3.  **Closing/Dismissing:** The user can click the '×' button at the top-right corner to close the widget and return to their previous view on the website. This gives them full control over their interface.

    There are no other interactive elements like buttons or forms within the widget itself. Its purpose is purely to deliver tracking information clearly and efficiently without distracting the user from other potential actions on the site.
