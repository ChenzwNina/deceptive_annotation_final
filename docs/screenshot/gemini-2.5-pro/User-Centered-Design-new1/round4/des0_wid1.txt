### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a clean, rectangular banner with rounded corners, positioned 20px from the top of the viewport. It has a white background with a subtle shadow, making it float above the page content. The color palette is neutral and professional: dark grey for text (#212529), a calming blue for prices and the "View Details" button (#007bff), and a light grey for the product card backgrounds (#f8f9fa).

The layout is organized with a clear heading and a grid of four product cards. Each card features a square image, a concise product title, price, and a button. This grid layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. These design choices are made to create a trustworthy and visually appealing component that is easy to scan. The high-contrast colors and clear hierarchy guide the user's attention to the products and their call-to-action without being distracting or aggressive.

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is typically triggered by a user's session initiation. It would most likely appear when a user first lands on the website's homepage or a major category page during a new visit. The purpose is to immediately present curated or popular items to guide the user's shopping journey, especially if they are a new visitor with no specific product in mind. It's not triggered by a specific user action (like scrolling or adding an item to the cart) but rather serves as a welcoming and promotional feature. For returning users, its appearance could be controlled by cookies to avoid showing it on every single visit, enhancing the user experience.

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have three primary interactions with this widget. First, they can visually browse the featured items, quickly assessing the products through their images, names, and prices. Second, they can engage with a specific product by clicking anywhere on its card—the image, title, or the "View Details" button. This action navigates them directly to the corresponding product detail page where they can get more information and make a purchase. Third, users have the option to dismiss the widget entirely by clicking the '×' close button located in the top-right corner. This allows them to hide the banner if they find it irrelevant or distracting, giving them full control over their browsing experience.
