Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a clean, rectangular container with rounded corners, positioned centrally at the top of the screen. It has a white background with a subtle shadow, making it float above the main page content. The color palette is professional and neutral: dark grey for text (#343a40), a bright, accessible blue for the price (#007bff) to draw attention, and a light grey for borders.

The layout features a prominent central title, "Our Top Picks This Week," above a four-column grid of product cards. Each card contains a square product image, a product name, and a price. The design uses generous white space and a clear hierarchy to feel uncluttered and easy to scan. This clean, structured aesthetic is common in modern e-commerce as it looks trustworthy, focuses user attention on the products, and avoids overwhelming the user with visual noise. The layout is also responsive, collapsing to two columns on tablets and one on mobile to ensure usability across all devices.

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is best triggered by a user's session start. It would appear on the initial page load (e.g., the homepage or a major landing page) for a user who has just arrived on the site or has started a new session. This approach ensures immediate visibility for key products without being persistently annoying.

To avoid being intrusive, the widget should only appear once per user session. Once the user dismisses it with the close button, it should not reappear until they start a new session (e.g., by closing the browser and returning later). This respects the user's choice to hide the element and prevents it from disrupting their shopping journey if they find it irrelevant. This trigger is user-friendly and avoids deceptive patterns like pop-ups that appear unexpectedly based on scroll depth or mouse movement.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have several clear and direct ways to interact with the widget:

1.  **Exploration:** Users can visually scan the four featured products, reading the titles and prices to quickly gauge interest. Hovering over any product card provides subtle visual feedback—it lifts slightly and gains a more pronounced shadow—indicating that it is an interactive element.

2.  **Navigation:** The entire product card (image, name, and price) is a clickable link. Clicking anywhere on a card will navigate the user directly to that specific product's detail page, where they can learn more, see additional images, and make a purchase.

3.  **Dismissal:** Users who are not interested in the featured products can click the '×' icon in the top-right corner. This action immediately and permanently closes the widget for the duration of their current session, returning their full, unobstructed view of the website.

4.  **Ignoring:** The widget is positioned at the top but does not block the main content. Users can simply ignore it and scroll past to continue browsing the rest of the page.
