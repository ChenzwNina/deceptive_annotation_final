Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

Answer: The component is a clean, modern section with the title "Featured This Week" centered at the top in a large, bold font. Below the title, four product cards are arranged in a responsive grid. Each card has a white background, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow that lifts it off the light-grey page background. The card contains a large product image, the product name, a brief description, the price, and a call-to-action button. 

The color palette is minimalist and professional: dark grey for text, a vibrant blue for the current price and "Add to Cart" button to draw attention, and a muted grey for old, crossed-out prices. This scheme ensures high readability and guides the user's eye to key information and actions. The design choices prioritize a trustworthy and uncluttered user experience, making the products the heroes of the component without overwhelming the user.

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

Answer: This component is a static part of a web page's content, not a dynamic pop-up or modal. Its appearance is triggered simply by a user navigating to the page where it is embedded, such as the homepage or a main category page. It loads along with the rest of the page content as the user scrolls down. It is designed to be an integral section of the page's layout, intended to immediately engage visitors by showcasing curated products without being intrusive. This approach respects the user's browsing experience and avoids the disruption associated with triggered overlays or banners.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Answer: Users have several intuitive interaction points with this widget. Visually, they can scan the products and prices. On a desktop, hovering over a product card causes it to lift slightly with an enhanced shadow, and the product image zooms in gently, providing visual feedback and encouraging a click. Hovering over the "Add to Cart" button changes its color to a darker blue, indicating it's a clickable element. The primary interactions are clicks: a user can click on the product image, title, or description (if linked) to navigate to the detailed product page for more information. Alternatively, they can click the "Add to Cart" button to directly add the item to their shopping cart, which would typically trigger a site-wide cart update or notification.
