Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a clean, rectangular card with rounded corners and a subtle shadow, giving it a modern, floating appearance. It uses a professional color palette: a white background for clarity, dark gray for primary text, and a calming, trustworthy blue for the main icon and call-to-action button. A vibrant green is used for the progress bar to visually communicate positive forward movement.

The layout is horizontally organized. The top section contains a delivery truck icon and a clear heading, "Your order is on the way!". Below this, a visual progress bar with four distinct stages (Ordered, Shipped, Out for Delivery, Delivered) provides an at-a-glance status update. The final section includes the latest text update and a prominent "View Full Details" button. This hierarchy guides the user from general status to specific details and finally to a clear action, creating an intuitive and efficient user experience.

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is triggered by the user's account status, not a specific action on the page. It would appear automatically for a logged-in user who has a recent order that is currently in the "shipped" or "out for delivery" phase.

Specifically, when the user visits a key page of the website, such as the homepage, their account dashboard, or even a product page, the system checks their recent order history. If an active, in-transit order is detected, the widget is rendered at the top of the page to proactively provide this relevant and timely information. It is designed to be a helpful, contextual notification rather than a popup that interrupts a user's flow. Once the order is delivered or the user dismisses the widget, it would no longer appear for that specific order.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have three primary interactions with this widget, designed for clarity and control:

1.  **View Details:** The main interaction is clicking the "View Full Details" button. This is the primary call-to-action and would navigate the user away from the current page to a dedicated order tracking page. This new page would provide comprehensive information, such as a shipping timeline, carrier details, and potentially a map view of the package's current location.

2.  **Dismissal:** Users can click the '×' (close) button located at the top-right corner. This action dismisses the widget for the current user session, allowing them to hide it if they have already noted the information. The widget might reappear on a subsequent visit if the order status is still pending.

3.  **Information Consumption:** The third interaction is passive. The user can quickly absorb all necessary high-level information without clicking anything. The visual progress bar, estimated arrival date, and the latest status update are designed to be scanned and understood in seconds, fulfilling its purpose as a quick, informative component.
