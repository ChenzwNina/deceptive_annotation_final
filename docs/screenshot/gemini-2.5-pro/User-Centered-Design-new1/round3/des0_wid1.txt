Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The component is a clean, modern-looking rectangular widget that "floats" at the top-center of the viewport. It has a white background, rounded corners, and a subtle box shadow to lift it off the page. The color palette is neutral, using shades of grey and black for text, with a vibrant blue for the call-to-action buttons to draw attention. The layout is a responsive grid; on wider screens, three product cards are arranged horizontally, while on smaller screens, they stack vertically. Elements are sized hierarchically: a bold main heading is followed by smaller product titles and descriptive text. This design is clean and professional, inspiring trust and focusing the user's attention directly on the products without distractions. The generous use of whitespace prevents a cluttered feeling and enhances readability.

    Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

    This component is designed as a static part of the page content, not a pop-up or a notification triggered by user action. It appears immediately on page load. Typically, it would be placed on a key page like the website's homepage or a main category page. Its purpose is to instantly greet visitors with a curated selection of popular or new items, encouraging immediate engagement and product discovery without requiring any user input. A subtle fade-in and slide-down animation is used on load to draw the eye to the component gracefully without being jarring.

    Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    The user interactions are straightforward and focused on product discovery. Users can:
    1.  **Hover:** When a user hovers their mouse over a product card, it lifts slightly and its shadow darkens. This provides clear visual feedback that the element is interactive.
    2.  **Click to Navigate:** Users can click anywhere on the product card—the image, title, or descriptive text—to be taken to that item's detailed product page for more information or to make a purchase.
    3.  **Click Call-to-Action:** Each card includes an explicit "View Details" button. Clicking this button performs the same action as clicking the card itself, providing a clear and direct path for users who prefer obvious action prompts.
    The component itself is not dismissible, as it functions as a primary content block rather than a temporary overlay.
