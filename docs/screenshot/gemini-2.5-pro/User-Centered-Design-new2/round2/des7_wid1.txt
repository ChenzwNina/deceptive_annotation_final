### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a clean, rectangular container with rounded corners and a subtle shadow, making it float above the page content. It has a white background for high contrast and readability. The layout is organized using flexbox. On the left, a small image of the product ("Zenith Pro Headset") is shown. To its right, the main content is split into two columns: a summary and a breakdown. The summary prominently features the large, bold average rating (e.g., "4.7") next to five gold-colored star icons and a link to the total number of reviews. The breakdown uses horizontal progress bars, also in gold, to visually represent the percentage of 5-star, 4-star, etc., reviews.

These choices are deliberate. The clean, neutral color scheme (white, dark grey text, gold accents) builds trust and feels professional, avoiding garish colors that could seem manipulative. The layout provides a clear information hierarchy: the overall score is immediately visible, while the detailed breakdown offers transparent, at-a-glance context for users who want more information, fulfilling rule 3.1 by not hiding or disguising important data.

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is triggered by user behavior that indicates a continued interest in the product while navigating away from the primary rating location. Specifically, it appears when the user is on a product detail page and scrolls down past the initial "buy box" area (where the product title, price, and ratings are typically first displayed). As the original rating information scrolls out of view, this component fades in and fixes itself to the top of the viewport. This ensures the crucial social proof provided by the rating remains persistently visible and accessible as the user explores product features, technical specifications, or other details further down the page, without being intrusive from the start. This trigger respects the user's initial focus and provides helpful context when it's most needed.

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

User interactions with the widget are simple, clear, and non-coercive, designed to inform rather than force an action. The full range includes:

1.  **Viewing Information:** The primary interaction is passive consumption. The user can immediately see the product's average rating, the number of reviews it's based on, and a visual breakdown of the rating distribution. This allows for quick, informed decision-making.

2.  **Dismissing the Widget:** The user has complete control to close the widget at any time by clicking the "×" button in the top-right corner. This action is straightforward, permanently hides the component for their current session, and requires no extra steps, adhering to rules 3.2 and 3.3.

3.  **Navigating to Full Reviews:** The user can click the "Based on 2,418 reviews" link. This is a standard hyperlink that will smoothly scroll the user down the page to the detailed customer reviews section, allowing them to read individual feedback. This provides a direct path to more detailed information without forcing them through an unintended flow.
