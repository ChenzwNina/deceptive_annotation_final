### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a clean, rectangular container with a white background and rounded corners, positioned centrally at the top of the screen. It uses a modern, sans-serif font for readability. The layout is structured logically: a main heading "Your Package is Arriving Soon!" and the order number are at the top left, with a subtle 'X' close button on the right. Below this, a visual progress bar and a three-step status list ("Shipped", "Out for Delivery", "Delivered") provide an at-a-glance update. The footer contains the estimated delivery date and a "View Order Details" button.

The color palette is intentionally simple and professional. A calm green (#2a7e49) is used as an accent for completed steps and the progress bar, signifying positive advancement. Neutral grays are used for text and inactive elements to maintain a clean, uncluttered look. This minimalist design ensures that the crucial information is immediately clear, building user trust and avoiding any feeling of alarm or unnecessary urgency. The layout guides the user's eye from the summary to the details naturally.

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is triggered when a logged-in user with a recently shipped and in-transit order visits a key page of the website, such as the homepage or their account dashboard. It should not appear on every single page load, as that would be intrusive. A good implementation would be to show it once per session or until the user explicitly dismisses it. The trigger is contextual and based on the user's current order status, aiming to provide timely and relevant information right when they might be looking for it, without them having to navigate to a separate "My Orders" page first. This proactive but non-disruptive approach enhances the user experience.

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have three primary interactions with the widget, all of which are straightforward and serve a clear purpose:

1.  **Information Consumption:** The main interaction is passive. The user can instantly see their order's headline status ("Out for Delivery"), check the estimated delivery date, and view their progress visually on the bar. This provides a quick, satisfying update without requiring any clicks.

2.  **Navigation to Details:** The user can click the "View Order Details" button. This is a clear call-to-action that navigates them to a dedicated page with more granular tracking information, such as carrier details, a tracking number, and a complete history of the shipment's journey.

3.  **Dismissal:** The user can click the '×' close button in the top-right corner. This action immediately and permanently removes the widget from view for the remainder of their session, giving them full control over their interface and preventing the widget from becoming an annoyance if they have already absorbed the information.
