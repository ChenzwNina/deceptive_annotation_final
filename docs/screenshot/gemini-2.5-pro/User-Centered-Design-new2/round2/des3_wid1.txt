## Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The search panel is a clean, rectangular component with rounded corners, positioned centrally at the top of the screen. It has a subtle shadow, giving it a floating effect over the page content. The layout uses Flexbox to seamlessly join a text input field on the left and a search button on the right.

    The color scheme is professional and high-contrast: a white background for the container, a light-grey border for the input field, dark text for legibility, and a strong, trustworthy blue for the search button. This blue makes the primary action—searching—highly visible.

    Elements are sized generously with a height of 44px, making them easy to tap on mobile devices. The font size of 16px ensures the input text is readable. These choices are made to create an accessible, intuitive, and modern user interface that feels familiar and easy to use, inspiring confidence and encouraging interaction without being obtrusive. The focus state, highlighted with a blue ring, provides clear feedback to the user.
    
    ## Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
    
    The appearance of this widget is not triggered by a user action; it is a persistent, core element of the user interface. It loads with the page and remains fixed at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls.

    This design choice is intentional. In an e-commerce context, searching is a primary method of navigation and product discovery. Making the search bar constantly visible and accessible removes friction and empowers users to look for an item at any point in their journey, whether they've just landed on the homepage or are browsing deep within a category. This immediate access to a key function is crucial for a positive and efficient user experience. It avoids forcing users to hunt for a hidden search icon or navigate back to the top of the page.
    
    ## Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    The user's interaction with the search panel is simple and follows standard web conventions, ensuring a predictable experience. The full range of interactions includes:

    1.  **Focusing the Input:** The user can click or tap inside the text field to activate it. This is visually confirmed by a blue outline (focus ring) and a blinking cursor, indicating it's ready for input.
    2.  **Typing a Query:** The user can type their search terms using a physical or on-screen keyboard. The specific placeholder text, "Search for laptops, sneakers, home decor...", guides them on the types of queries they can make.
    3.  **Submitting via Button:** The user can click or tap the blue search button containing the magnifying glass icon to execute the search and be taken to the results page.
    4.  **Submitting via Keyboard:** After typing a query, the user can press the "Enter" or "Go" key on their keyboard to submit the form, which performs the same action as clicking the search button.
    
    These interactions are designed to be efficient and accessible for all users, regardless of their device or input method.
