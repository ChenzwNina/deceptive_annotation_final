Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The component is a clean, modern banner positioned at the top of the viewport. It has a white background with a subtle border and soft box-shadow, giving it a slight elevation over the page content. The color palette is primarily neutral (white, grays, and dark text) with a single accent color—a vibrant blue (#007aff)—used for the product prices and "View Details" buttons. This draws the user's eye to key information and interactive elements.

    The layout is a responsive grid that adapts the number of products per row based on screen size. Each product card has a square image, a clear title, the price, and a button. The typography is a standard, highly-readable sans-serif font. These design choices are made to create a professional, trustworthy, and aesthetically pleasing interface that is easy for users to scan and understand, without distracting them from their primary shopping journey. The rounded corners on the container and cards provide a softer, more approachable feel.

    Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

    This widget is designed as a discovery tool, not an intrusive pop-up. Its appearance is triggered by the loading of specific, high-traffic pages, such as the website's homepage or main category pages. It appears immediately with the page content, positioned neatly at the top. It is not triggered by user inaction, scroll depth, or exit intent, as those methods can feel disruptive. By presenting it as a static, yet dismissible, part of the initial page view, the design respects the user's flow and offers helpful suggestions without forcing an interaction. The widget remains in its fixed position as the user scrolls, keeping the featured items accessible until the user chooses to dismiss it.

    Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    Users have a clear and straightforward set of interactions with the widget, designed to be helpful and non-restrictive.
    
    1.  **Passive Viewing:** Users can simply view the curated products to discover items they might not have found otherwise.
    2.  **Hovering:** When a user hovers their mouse over a product card, it lifts slightly and gains a more prominent shadow. This visual feedback signals that the card is an interactive element.
    3.  **Navigation:** Clicking anywhere on a product card—the image, the title, or the "View Details" button—will navigate the user to that specific product's detail page where they can learn more and make a purchase.
    4.  **Dismissal:** A prominent '×' close button is located in the top-right corner. Clicking this button will immediately and permanently hide the widget for the duration of the user's session. This empowers the user, giving them full control over their browsing experience without any penalty or dark patterns trying to dissuade them.
