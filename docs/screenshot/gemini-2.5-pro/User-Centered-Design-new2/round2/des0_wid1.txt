Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component is a wide, rectangular banner with a light gray background (`#f8f9fa`) and a soft shadow, giving it a subtle elevation from the page content. It features a prominent, dark gray heading ("Discover Our Top Picks") centered above a grid of four product cards. Each card has a clean white background and contains a product image, name, category, price, and a call-to-action button. The color palette is neutral, using shades of gray for text and borders, with a vibrant, accessible blue (`#007bff`) for prices and buttons to draw attention to key information and actions. The layout is a responsive flexbox grid, ensuring the cards are evenly spaced and wrap gracefully on smaller screens. This clean, organized design avoids overwhelming the user, creating a trustworthy and professional appearance that focuses attention on the products themselves without distraction.

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This "Featured Products" widget is designed to appear for first-time visitors or users beginning a new session. Its trigger is typically tied to loading the homepage or a major category landing page. The goal is to immediately orient the user and showcase popular or curated items, acting as a helpful starting point for their shopping journey. It is not triggered by an intrusive action like a pop-up after a set time, as that would interrupt the user's flow. Instead, it appears as a static, yet dismissible, part of the initial page view. Once a user closes the widget using the '×' button, a session cookie would typically be set to prevent it from reappearing during that same visit, respecting the user's choice to hide it.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have three clear and direct interactions with the widget:

1.  **Exploration and Navigation:** The primary interaction is clicking the "View Details" button on any product card. This is a low-commitment action that navigates the user to the corresponding product detail page to learn more. Users can also gain minimal feedback by hovering over a card, which causes it to lift slightly, indicating it's an interactive element.

2.  **Dismissal:** Users have full control to hide the component. A clearly visible '×' button is located in the top-right corner. Clicking this button removes the widget from the viewport for the remainder of their session, freeing up screen space and allowing them to focus on other content.

3.  **Passive Viewing:** Users can simply view the product suggestions and scroll past the widget to engage with the main content of the page. The component does not obstruct the page or force any interaction, allowing users to ignore it completely if the featured items are not relevant to their interests.
