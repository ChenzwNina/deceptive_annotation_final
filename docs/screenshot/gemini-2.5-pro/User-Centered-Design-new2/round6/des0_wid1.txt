### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component is a full-width white banner with a clean, modern aesthetic. It features a centered heading "Curated For You This Week" above a grid of four product cards. Each card has a 1:1 aspect ratio image, a product category in a subtle grey, a bold product name, a clear price, and a green "View Details" button. The color palette is intentionally simple: white and light greys for backgrounds, dark text for readability, a vibrant blue for the standard price, and a contrasting green for the call-to-action buttons.

These choices are made for clarity and trust. The spacious, grid-based layout is easy to scan. The neutral color scheme prevents distraction, while the strategic use of color for prices and buttons guides the user's attention to key information and actions. The soft shadows and hover effects provide a responsive, high-quality feel without being overwhelming, creating a pleasant and straightforward shopping experience.

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This component is not triggered by a specific user action like a click or a timer. Instead, it is an integral part of the page's static content, typically placed near the top of a key landing page such as the homepage or a main category page. It loads with the rest of the page and is immediately visible to the user. Its key behavior is its 'sticky' positioning. As the user scrolls down the page, the component remains fixed at the top of the viewport (with a 20px margin), ensuring the featured products stay in sight for an extended period before the user scrolls past that section of the page's content. This makes it a persistent but non-intrusive promotional element.

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

User interaction with this widget is designed to be simple and intuitive. The primary interactions are:

1.  **Visual Scanning:** Users can easily browse the featured products, absorbing key information like the product image, name, and price without needing to click anything.
2.  **Hovering:** When a user moves their mouse cursor over a product card, it provides visual feedback by lifting slightly and gaining a more prominent shadow. The "View Details" button also darkens. This indicates that the element is interactive.
3.  **Navigation:** The core interaction is clicking. A user can click anywhere on a product card—the image, the text, or the explicit "View Details" button—to be navigated directly to that specific product's detailed page. This design uses the entire card as a clickable target to make it easier for users to engage with a product that interests them.

There are no other complex interactions, pop-ups, or forms, ensuring a direct and frictionless path for the user.
