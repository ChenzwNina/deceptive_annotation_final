Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The widget is a clean, card-style component with a white background, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow, making it float above the page content. It's fixed at the top center of the viewport. The color palette is minimal and professional: black and dark gray for text, a warm gold (#FFC107) for the stars and progress bars, and a standard blue for the link. This combination is designed to be trustworthy and easy to read. 

    The layout has a clear visual hierarchy. The overall score ("4.6") is the largest element, drawing immediate attention. Below it, the star icons and total rating count provide quick context. A detailed star-rating breakdown uses progress bars for an at-a-glance understanding of the rating distribution. This transparent presentation of information helps users make informed decisions quickly without feeling overwhelmed or manipulated.

    Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

    This widget is designed to appear based on a user's scroll behavior on a product detail page. It would trigger when the user scrolls past the primary product information area (which typically includes the product title, images, and the static rating summary). 

    This trigger is chosen to be helpful rather than intrusive. It avoids interrupting the user's initial assessment of the product. Instead, it appears as they scroll down to seek more details (like the product description or technical specifications), serving as a persistent, convenient reminder of the product's social proof. This ensures the widget provides value at a relevant point in the user's journey without disrupting their flow.

    Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    Users have three straightforward and intuitive interactions with the widget, respecting their autonomy and intent:

    1.  **Passive Viewing:** The primary interaction is informational. Users can instantly see the overall score, the visual star rating, and the distribution of ratings from 5-star to 1-star. This allows for a quick, passive assessment of the product's reception.

    2.  **Exploring Further:** Users can click the "Read all 872 reviews" link. This action is a clear call-to-action that would smoothly scroll the user down to the main customer reviews section of the page, allowing them to delve deeper into specific feedback.

    3.  **Dismissing:** For users who are not interested in the rating summary, a clearly visible '×' close button is provided. Clicking this button dismisses the widget, removing it from view and allowing the user to continue browsing without obstruction. This action is simple and final for the session.
