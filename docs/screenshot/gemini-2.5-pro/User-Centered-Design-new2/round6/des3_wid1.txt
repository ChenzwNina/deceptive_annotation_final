### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The search panel is a clean, rectangular widget with rounded corners, centered horizontally and positioned 20px from the top of the screen. It has a soft white background and a subtle shadow, making it float above the main page content. The primary color palette is neutral (white, grays, and black text) to ensure clarity. A vibrant, accessible blue is used exclusively for the primary action button (the search button), drawing the user's attention to the main function.

The layout is spacious and organized. The core component is a large search input field, taking up most of the width, paired with the blue search button. Below this, a "Popular Searches" section provides helpful, clickable tags in a light gray. A distinct '×' button for closing is placed at the top right for easy dismissal. These choices prioritize usability and a non-intrusive, modern aesthetic. The large input field and clear button make interaction effortless, and the neutral colors prevent distraction, creating a trustworthy and professional feel.

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this search panel is triggered by an explicit user action, typically clicking on a search icon (often a magnifying glass) or a search text field located in the website's main header or navigation bar. When the user signals their intent to search, this overlay appears, providing a larger, focused interface for the task. This design avoids being an unsolicited distraction like a pop-up. It only appears when the user asks for it, which respects their control over the browsing experience and ensures the component is helpful rather than intrusive. This approach adheres to the principle of not forcing users into an interaction they did not initiate.

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have four clear and direct interactions with the widget, designed for simplicity and control:

1.  **Perform a Custom Search:** The user can click inside the large input field, type any product, brand, or query they wish, and then either click the blue search button with the magnifying glass icon or press the 'Enter' key on their keyboard to submit the search.

2.  **Use a Suggested Search:** Instead of typing, the user can click on any of the pre-populated links under "Popular Searches" (e.g., "Wireless Headphones"). This action will immediately execute a search for that specific term.

3.  **Close the Panel:** If the user decides not to search, they can click the '×' icon in the top-right corner at any time. This will dismiss the search panel and return them to the page they were previously viewing without interrupting their journey.

4.  **Refine a Search:** A user can type a query, and then edit or clear it using standard text input controls before submitting.

These interactions provide both guided discovery (popular searches) and full user control (custom search and closing), without any hidden or difficult steps.
