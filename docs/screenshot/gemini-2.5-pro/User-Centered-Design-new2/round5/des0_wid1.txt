## Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component is a clean, modern-looking container with a prominent title, "Editor's Picks: Style & Innovation," centered at the top. Below the title, four product cards are arranged in a responsive grid. The overall color palette is professional and neutral, using a white background for the component, a light gray page background (#f4f5f7), dark text for readability (#172B4D), and a strong blue (#0052CC) for the price and call-to-action buttons to draw attention.

Each product card has a square image, a product name (18px, bold), a category (14px, gray), the price (18px, bold blue), and a solid blue "View Details" button. The layout within the card is vertical, ensuring a clear flow of information. These choices create a scannable, visually appealing, and trustworthy interface. The consistent sizing and spacing provide a structured look, while the hover effect adds a subtle, satisfying micro-interaction.

## Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is not triggered by a specific user action like a click or a timer. It is an integrated part of the web page's content, intended to be always visible in its designated section, similar to a hero banner or a product category list. It loads with the page and is designed using `position: sticky`, which means it will scroll with the page normally until it reaches the top of the viewport (with its 20px margin), at which point it "sticks" there as the user continues to scroll down. This ensures the featured products remain visible and accessible without being an intrusive pop-up or overlay that interrupts the user's journey.

## Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

User interactions with this widget are intentionally simple and direct, focused on browsing and discovery. The full range of interactions includes:

1.  **Visual Browsing:** Users can scan the component to see the curated list of featured products, quickly absorbing the product image, name, and price for each item.
2.  **Hovering:** When a user moves their cursor over a product card, it gently lifts and gains a more pronounced shadow. This provides visual feedback, indicating that the element is interactive. Hovering over the "View Details" button causes its background color to brighten, reinforcing its clickability.
3.  **Navigation:** Users can click on any part of a product card (the image, title, or the "View Details" button) to be taken directly to that product's detailed page. This provides a large, easy-to-use click target, making navigation effortless.

There are no forms to fill out, pop-ups to close, or complex menus to navigate within the component itself.
