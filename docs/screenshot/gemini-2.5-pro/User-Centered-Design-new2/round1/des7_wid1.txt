Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a clean, rectangular banner with rounded corners, positioned 20 pixels from the top of the screen. It has a white background with a subtle shadow to make it stand out from the page content. The layout uses Flexbox to organize elements horizontally: star ratings on the left, followed by text, a call-to-action button, and a close button on the far right.

Colors: The text is a dark, near-black color (#172b4d) for high readability. The stars are a warm gold (#FFC107) to be instantly recognizable. The call-to-action button is a strong, trustworthy blue (#0052cc) to encourage clicks, while the close button is a neutral gray (#5e6c84).

Elements: The star icons are large and clear. The main text "Rated 4.7 / 5.0" is bold and larger than the secondary text "Based on 15,281 reviews" to create a clear information hierarchy.

These choices are made to create a component that feels trustworthy, is easy to read at a glance, and doesn't aggressively interrupt the user's journey. The design is noticeable but not obnoxious, providing helpful social proof in an accessible and professional manner.

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this site-wide rating widget is triggered by user behavior designed to be helpful without being intrusive. The ideal trigger would be for it to appear for new visitors after a short delay, such as 5-10 seconds after the homepage has loaded. This delay ensures the user has had a moment to orient themselves on the site before the banner appears. Alternatively, it could be triggered by a scroll depth, appearing only after the user has scrolled 25% down the page. This signals that the user is engaged and potentially interested in learning more about the company's reputation. Once a user dismisses the widget, a cookie or session storage should be used to prevent it from reappearing during the same browsing session, respecting the user's choice to hide it. This approach avoids immediate interruption and targets users who are actively exploring the site.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have three clear and distinct interactions with the widget, catering to different intentions:

1.  **Passive Observation:** The primary interaction is simply viewing the information. A user can quickly glance at the banner, absorb the high-level rating (4.7 stars) and the large number of reviews, and gain confidence in the brand without taking any action. The information is presented clearly to be understood in seconds.

2.  **Engagement:** If the user's interest is piqued, they can click the prominent blue "Read Customer Stories" button. This is the primary call-to-action, which would navigate them to a dedicated page containing detailed customer reviews, testimonials, and stories, allowing for deeper exploration of the company's reputation.

3.  **Dismissal:** If the user is not interested or finds the banner distracting, they can click the '×' close button. This action immediately and permanently removes the banner for the duration of their browsing session. This interaction is designed to be effortless, respecting the user's control over their interface and ensuring the widget does not become an annoyance.
