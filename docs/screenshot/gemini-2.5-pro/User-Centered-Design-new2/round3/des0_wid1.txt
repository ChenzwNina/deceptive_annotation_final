Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component is a clean, wide banner that remains "sticky" at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls. It has a soft white background, a subtle border, and a gentle box-shadow to lift it off the page content. The color palette is neutral and professional, using dark gray for primary text and a deep teal as a single accent for prices, creating a calm and trustworthy feel. The layout is organized with a clear title, "Discover Our Top Picks," on the left and a highly visible "×" close button on the right. Below this header, a horizontally scrollable row of product cards is displayed. Each card is uniformly sized with a large, square product image, followed by a clearly legible product name and price. These choices prioritize clarity and a non-intrusive user experience, allowing users to easily browse products without feeling overwhelmed or pressured. The focus is on showcasing products in an elegant, accessible manner.

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This widget is not triggered by a user action like a timer or scroll depth, as that can be intrusive. Instead, it is an integral part of the page's static layout, loading immediately with the rest of the content on key pages such as the homepage or main category pages. It is designed to be a discovery tool, not a disruptive advertisement. By being present from the start, it feels like a native and helpful part of the website, offering curated suggestions to the user as soon as they arrive. This approach respects the user's browsing flow and provides immediate value, positioning the feature as a helpful guide rather than an interruption. The user maintains full control and can choose to interact with it or dismiss it at any time.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have several straightforward and intuitive ways to interact with the widget. First, they can horizontally scroll through the list of products using their mouse, trackpad, or by swiping on a touch device. Second, they can hover over any product card, which provides a subtle visual feedback cue by lifting the card slightly with an increased shadow, indicating it's an interactive element. Third, they can click anywhere on a product card to navigate directly to that product's detailed description page. This makes the entire card a large, easy-to-use link. Finally, if the user is not interested in the suggestions, they can click the prominent "×" button in the top-right corner. This action dismisses the banner, removing it from view and allowing the user to focus on the rest of the page content without distraction. All interactions are designed to be direct, predictable, and to give the user complete control over their experience.
