Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component is a clean, rectangular banner with rounded corners and a subtle shadow, giving it a modern, slightly elevated appearance. It's centered on the page with a 20px top margin. The color palette is intentionally calm, using an off-white background (`#F8F9FA`), dark grey text for readability (`#343A40`), and a deep, trustworthy blue (`#005B96`) for primary actions. This scheme fosters trust and avoids causing user anxiety.

The layout consists of a header with a clear title ("Editor's Picks...") and a non-aggressive '×' close button. Below this is a responsive grid of three product cards. Each card has an image, a descriptive title, a clear price, and two distinct buttons: a solid blue "Add to Cart" and an outlined "View Details". This separation of actions supports user autonomy by providing clear choices. Generous spacing and a readable sans-serif font are used throughout to ensure the design is accessible and uncluttered, helping all users succeed.

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This widget is designed to be a static part of a key landing page, such as the homepage or a main category page, rather than a dynamically triggered pop-up or overlay. Its appearance is triggered simply by the user navigating to one of these pages. This approach is chosen specifically to respect the user's control and autonomy (Rule #7, #12). It does not interrupt their task or unexpectedly block content, which can cause frustration and erode trust. By integrating it into the natural flow of the page, it acts as a helpful, curated guide rather than an intrusive advertisement. This predictable behavior ensures the system behaves as expected, fostering user trust and a sense of calm.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have a clear and straightforward range of interactions designed for clarity and control.

1.  **Viewing:** The primary interaction is passive viewing of the curated products, allowing users to discover items without any pressure.
2.  **Information Seeking:** Users can click the "View Details" link on any product card. This respects their need for informed consent (Rule #8) by allowing them to learn more before committing to a purchase.
3.  **Purchasing:** Clicking the "Add to Cart" button performs that direct action. The visual distinction between this primary action and the secondary "View Details" link helps prevent accidental clicks and supports deliberate choice.
4.  **Dismissal:** Users can click the '×' button in the top-right corner to close the component. This action respects their autonomy (Rule #7) and gives them control over their browsing environment. Ideally, this choice would be remembered for the duration of their session.
5.  **Accessibility:** All interactive elements (buttons, links) have distinct hover and focus states, ensuring the component is fully navigable using a keyboard, which enables all users to succeed (Rule #5).
