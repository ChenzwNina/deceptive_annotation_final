Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The component is a clean, rectangular banner with rounded corners, positioned horizontally at the top of the viewport. It has a white background with a subtle shadow and a light gray border, making it feel modern and lifted from the page content. The layout is organized from left to right: a 50x50 pixel product image, the order status text, a primary action button, and a dismiss icon. I used a calm and trustworthy color palette: deep blue for the primary "View Live Tracking" button to signal a safe, primary action, and neutral grays for text to ensure readability and reduce anxiety. This design promotes a feeling of calm and control (Rule 3.12) by presenting clear, actionable information without alarming colors or a cluttered layout. The predictable structure helps users succeed in their goal of getting information quickly (Rule 3.5) and fosters trust through its professional appearance (Rule 3.6).

    Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

    The appearance of this widget is triggered contextually to provide timely and relevant information without being intrusive. The primary trigger is when a user with an active order logs in or visits a main page like the homepage or their account dashboard. It appears specifically when the order reaches a key milestone, such as "Shipped" or, as shown, "Out for Delivery." It could also be triggered in real-time via a WebSocket event if the order status changes while the user is actively browsing the site. This approach ensures the information is presented when it's most valuable, helping reduce user anxiety about their purchase. By not showing it for "Processing" or "Delivered" orders, the design avoids information overload and respects the user's attention, supporting user autonomy and welfare (Rules 3.7 and 3.1).

    Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    Users have three clear interaction paths, designed to support their autonomy and control. First, the primary interaction is clicking the "View Live Tracking" button. This action would navigate them to a detailed tracking page, likely with a map and delivery history, fulfilling their primary goal of getting more information. Second, they can click the '×' close button. This immediately dismisses the widget for their current session, giving them full control over their screen space (Rule 3.12). This action respects their choice to ignore the update. Third, the user can choose to not interact at all. The widget is designed to be informational but not disruptive, allowing them to continue browsing the site without taking any action on the tracker. This full range of options—engage, dismiss, or ignore—ensures the user feels in command and the design is helpful rather than demanding.
