Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component is a horizontally scrollable row of product cards beneath a clear heading, "Our Featured Selection." The color palette is calming and professional, using a soft off-white background (#F8F9FA), clean white cards (#FFFFFF), and a deep, trustworthy green (#0A5C36) as the primary accent for prices and buttons. Text is a highly readable dark gray, not pure black, to reduce eye strain.

The layout uses generous spacing and rounded corners to feel modern and approachable. Each product card has a fixed width (300px), ensuring a consistent, uncluttered presentation as the user scrolls. These choices are deliberate to make users feel calm and in control (Rule 3.12). The clear, non-deceptive labeling and professional aesthetic help foster user trust (Rule 3.6), while the clean layout and high-contrast text ensure the design is accessible and enables all users to succeed (Rule 3.5).

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is not triggered by a specific user action like a click or scroll event. Instead, it is a static component that loads as part of the main page content, typically on a homepage or a major category page. It is designed to be an integrated, non-intrusive part of the browsing experience rather than an interruption.

This design choice directly supports user autonomy (Rule 3.7) and helps users feel in control (Rule 3.12). By avoiding pop-ups, overlays, or aggressive animations, the component respects the user's attention and allows them to engage with the featured products at their own pace. It behaves reliably as a standard section of the website, which fosters trust (Rule 3.6) because it doesn’t violate user expectations of how a webpage should function.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have a clear and limited set of interactions designed for simplicity and control.

1.  **Scrolling:** Users can scroll horizontally through the product list using a mouse, trackpad, or touch gesture on mobile devices. The custom scrollbar provides a visual indicator of their position.

2.  **Hover/Focus:** When a user hovers over a product card with a mouse, it gently lifts with a subtle shadow effect, providing visual feedback. For keyboard users, tabbing onto the card's links or button will trigger a similar focus state (a visible outline), ensuring accessibility (Rule 3.5).

3.  **Navigation:** Users can click on the product image, its title (which would be linked), or the explicit "View Details" button. All these actions will navigate them to the corresponding product detail page. This provides multiple access points to information, giving users choice and supporting their goal of learning more before purchasing. The call-to-action "View Details" rather than "Buy Now" supports informed consent and preserves the user's moral agency by not pressuring an immediate purchase (Rules 3.8, 3.9).
