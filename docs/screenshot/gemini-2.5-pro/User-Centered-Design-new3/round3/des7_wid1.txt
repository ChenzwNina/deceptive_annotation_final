Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?
    Answer 1: The widget has a clean, modern design with a white background and a subtle shadow, making it float above the page content. The layout is a two-column grid on wider screens, with the overall rating summary on the left and a detailed breakdown on the right. The color palette is intentionally simple: neutral grays and blacks for text ensure readability, a warm gold (#ffc107) for stars and progress bars provides a positive and standard visual cue for ratings, and a calm blue (#007bff) is used for actionable links. The overall score ("4.8") is the largest element, establishing a clear visual hierarchy. This design fosters trust and calm by being transparent, organized, and free of distracting elements, helping users to quickly and confidently assess product quality.

    Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
    Answer 2: The request specified the component be positioned at the top of the viewport. As implemented, this is a fixed-position component, meaning its appearance is triggered immediately when a user navigates to and loads a page where it is included, such as a product detail page. It remains in a fixed position at the top of the screen as the user scrolls, ensuring that this key trust-building information is always visible. In a more conventional, non-fixed implementation, it would simply appear as part of the static page content, typically near the product title, and would scroll with the page.

    Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?
    Answer 3: Users have both passive and active interactions. Passively, a user can quickly glance at the component to absorb the overall score, the visual star rating, and the total number of ratings, giving them a quick assessment. They can also passively scan the rating breakdown bars to understand the distribution of positive versus negative reviews. Actively, a user can click the "Write a Review" link. This action would typically open a modal or navigate them to a new form where they can submit their own rating and comments. A small text note proactively informs them that their username will be public, supporting informed consent and privacy. This empowers users to both consume and contribute information, fostering a sense of community and control.
