**Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?**

The component is a rectangular banner with rounded corners and a subtle shadow, making it float cleanly above the page content. Its layout is a single, horizontal row that is centered on the screen. The background color is a calm, light blue (#eaf2ff) with dark blue text (#1c2a4e) for high contrast and readability, which is crucial for accessibility (Rule 3.5). The call-to-action (CTA) button uses a stronger, saturated blue (#0052cc) to attract attention without causing alarm. A prominent '×' button is placed on the far right for easy dismissal. These choices were made to create a calm, trustworthy, and helpful user experience (Rule 3.12). The design avoids aggressive colors or demanding language, instead presenting the information clearly to help users make an informed choice without pressure (Rule 3.8).

**Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?**

The banner appears automatically upon page load when a user visits key pages of the e-commerce website, such as the homepage, category pages, or popular product landing pages. It is not triggered by a specific user action like scrolling or clicking. This approach ensures that all visitors are immediately and transparently informed of major site-wide promotions without being intrusive. The appearance is a passive event, intended as a helpful notification rather than a reaction to user behavior. This respects user autonomy by presenting information upfront without demanding interaction (Rule 3.7) and ensures all users have an equal opportunity to benefit from the deals (Rule 3.5).

**Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?**

Users have three clear and simple interaction paths with the banner, giving them complete control.
1.  **Engage:** The user can click the "Shop All Deals" button. This action navigates them directly to a dedicated page showcasing all the items included in the sale, fulfilling the promise made in the banner text.
2.  **Dismiss:** The user can click the '×' close button. This immediately removes the banner from their view, and ideally, this action would be remembered for their session to prevent it from reappearing, respecting their choice to decline the offer (Rule 3.7).
3.  **Ignore:** The user can choose to do nothing. Since the banner is fixed at the top but does not obstruct the core content or functionality of the page, they are free to scroll and interact with the rest of the website without interference. This frictionless design helps users feel in control and not forced into an interaction (Rule 3.12).
