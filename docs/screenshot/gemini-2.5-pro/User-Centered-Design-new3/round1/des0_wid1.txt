Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component is a horizontally scrolling carousel of product cards under a clear heading, "Our Top Picks For You." The overall color palette is calm and neutral, using a light grey page background (#F8F9FA) and clean white for the cards (#FFFFFF). Text is a highly readable dark grey (#212529). The "View Details" button uses a friendly, accessible blue (#007BFF) that inspires trust rather than a high-pressure red or orange. Each product card is 280px wide with rounded corners and a subtle shadow, making it feel modern and approachable. The layout is spacious and uncluttered.

These choices are intentional to create a sense of calm and control for the user (Rule 3.12). The clear, honest presentation of product information, free of distracting elements, fosters trust (Rule 3.6). The clean layout and high-contrast text ensure the component is accessible and easy to understand, helping all users succeed (Rule 3.5). The design guides discovery without demanding immediate action, respecting the user's autonomy (Rule 3.7).

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is not triggered by a specific user action like a click or timer. Instead, it is a static component that loads as part of the page content, typically on the homepage or a main category page. It is positioned near the top of the page structure (with a 20px top margin) to be visible without being intrusive.

This design choice is crucial for respecting user autonomy and welfare (Rules 3.7 & 3.1). By being a predictable part of the page layout rather than a pop-up or a dynamically injected element that shifts content, it avoids startling the user or hijacking their attention. It behaves as an expected, reliable part of the website, fostering trust (Rule 3.6). The user can choose to engage with it or simply scroll past it, ensuring they remain in full control of their browsing experience (Rule 3.12).

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

User interactions with this widget are designed to be simple, predictable, and empowering. The full range of interactions includes:

1.  **Scrolling:** The primary interaction is horizontally scrolling through the product cards. On touch devices, this is done with a natural swipe gesture. On desktops, a user can click and drag or use a mouse wheel if their device supports it. The scrollbar is hidden to maintain a clean look, but the scrolling functionality is intuitive.

2.  **Hovering (Desktop):** When a user hovers their mouse over a product card, it gently lifts with a subtle shadow effect. This provides clear visual feedback that the element is interactive without being distracting.

3.  **Clicking:** A user can click on the "View Details" button to navigate directly to that product's specific page. This call-to-action is clear and unambiguous.

These limited and straightforward interactions ensure the system behaves reliably (Rule 3.6) and helps the user feel calm and in control (Rule 3.12). There are no hidden menus, complex gestures, or unexpected outcomes, which supports user autonomy and trust.
