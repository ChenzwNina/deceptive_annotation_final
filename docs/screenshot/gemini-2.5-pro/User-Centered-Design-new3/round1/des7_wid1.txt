**Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?**

The component is a clean, card-style widget with rounded corners and a subtle shadow, making it float visually above the page content. It has a bright white background (`#ffffff`) for clarity. The layout is split into two main columns: the left features the large, bold overall score ("4.8") in dark grey text (`#212529`), with five gold-colored stars (`#ffc107`) and the total review count below it. The right column displays a detailed breakdown with progress bars for each star rating (1-5), also in gold. At the bottom, a primary action button ("Read all reviews") in a calm, trustworthy blue (`#005fcc`) encourages further exploration, while a secondary link ("Write a review") provides an option for user contribution. These design choices create a strong visual hierarchy, guiding the user from the high-level summary to the details. The professional and calm color palette fosters trust and avoids causing user anxiety, ensuring the design helps users feel in control.

**Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?**

The widget’s appearance is triggered by the loading of the page it belongs to, typically a product detail page. It is not a pop-up that appears after a user action. I have implemented it using `position: fixed` in CSS, which anchors it to the viewport. This means it is visible as soon as the page loads, positioned 20 pixels from the top, and remains in that same spot as the user scrolls down the page. This persistent visibility ensures that this crucial trust-building information (the product's rating) is always accessible to the user as they browse product details, photos, and descriptions further down the page. This approach is predictable and non-intrusive, respecting the user's focus while keeping important information readily available to aid their purchasing decision.

**Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?**

Users can interact with the widget in three main ways, all designed to be clear and empower the user. First is **information consumption**: users can passively view the overall score, star rating, and the detailed breakdown to quickly gauge product quality. This is the primary, zero-click interaction. Second is **deeper exploration**: users can click the prominent "Read all 1,234 reviews" button. This action would navigate them to a full section of individual user reviews, allowing for a more in-depth analysis. Third is **contribution**: users can click the "Write a review" link. This gives them the agency to share their own experience, which would typically lead to a review submission form or modal. Additionally, standard hover effects on the button and link provide visual feedback, confirming their interactivity. All interactions are optional and user-initiated, supporting user autonomy.
