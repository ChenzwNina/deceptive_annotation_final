### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a clean, rectangular card centered at the top of the viewport. It features a soft off-white background (#F8F9FA) with a subtle border and a gentle shadow, making it feel distinct but not intrusive. The layout uses ample padding and vertical spacing to create an uncluttered, organized appearance.

Text is a highly readable dark gray (#212529), with benefits highlighted by a positive green checkmark (✓). The primary call-to-action button is a clear, trustworthy blue (#007BFF), designed to draw the eye without creating alarm. All elements have rounded corners for a friendlier feel. These choices were made to foster a sense of calm and control (Rule 3.12). The high-contrast text and clear, logical layout enable all users to succeed (Rule 3.5), while the professional aesthetic helps build user trust (Rule 3.6).

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is triggered by user engagement, not by an immediate, disruptive event. It is designed to appear under one of two conditions to respect the user's initial browsing session:

1.  **On the second page view:** The widget appears after the user has navigated from their initial landing page to a second page on the site.
2.  **After a significant scroll:** On a long page (like a product listing), the widget can be triggered after the user has scrolled past 60% of the page's content.

This "delayed" trigger approach respects the user's autonomy (Rule 3.7) by allowing them to first orient themselves and engage with the site's content. It avoids interrupting their primary task upon arrival, which protects their well-being by reducing initial frustration (Rule 3.1).

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have a complete and straightforward range of interactions, empowering them with full control over the component.

1.  **Dismissal:** The user can immediately click the '×' button in the top-right corner to close the widget and continue their browsing session without interruption. This provides a clear exit path and supports user autonomy (Rule 3.7).
2.  **Information:** The user can read the headline, a descriptive paragraph, and a bulleted list of clear benefits to understand the value proposition. This ensures informed consent (Rule 3.8).
3.  **Learn More:** They can click the "Terms of Service" or "Privacy Policy" links to understand the legal and data-handling specifics before committing, which protects their privacy and rights (Rules 3.3, 3.8).
4.  **Engagement:** The user can type their email address into the clearly labeled input field.
5.  **Confirmation:** They can click the "Join & Get 15% Off" button to submit their email and sign up for the membership.
