4.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The "Featured Products" widget is a full-width section with a light grey background (`#f8f9fa`) that distinguishes it from the main page content. It’s designed to stick 20px from the top of the viewport upon scrolling. Inside, a centered container (max-width 1200px) holds a prominent, dark grey title ("Don't Miss These Top Picks!", 2.2em font size) and a responsive grid of product cards.
    Each product card has a white background (`#FFFFFF`) with rounded corners and a subtle shadow that intensifies on hover. Product images are displayed at the top of the card within a 4:3 aspect ratio container, ensuring visual consistency. If a product is discounted, a bold red badge (`#e74c3c`) highlights the savings on the top-left of the image.
    Product names are clear and bold (1.25em, dark grey). Short descriptions use a softer grey (`#6c757d`). Prices are prominent: sale prices are larger and green (`#28a745`), while original prices are smaller, grey (`#adb5bd`), and struck-through. Call-to-action (CTA) buttons are full-width within the card, have a vibrant blue background (`#007bff`), white text, and a slight scaling effect on hover.

    Design Choices Rationale:
    - **Layout & Stickiness:** Maximizes visibility and engagement (Rules 3.1, 3.4, 3.9). The grid efficiently showcases multiple products (Rules 3.3, 3.5).
    - **Colors:** The palette is chosen for clarity, trust, and to guide attention. White cards provide a clean product focus. Green for sale prices positively denotes value, red for discount badges creates urgency, and blue for CTAs is a standard for actions (Rules 3.1, 3.2).
    - **Visual Hierarchy & Sizing:** Elements are sized to draw attention appropriately – large title, prominent images, clear prices, and accessible CTAs improve scannability and user experience (Rules 3.1, 3.2).
    - **Interactivity:** Hover effects provide feedback and enhance the perceived quality, contributing to a better user experience and potentially higher conversion rates (Rule 3.2).
    These choices aim to create an inviting, trustworthy, and conversion-focused component.

    4.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

    The widget appears automatically when the page loads; its appearance is not triggered by a specific user action like a click or hover on another element. It is designed as an integral part of the page, likely a homepage or a category page, intended to be immediately visible.
    Furthermore, due to its `position: sticky` CSS property with `top: 20px;`, the widget will remain "stuck" 20 pixels from the top of the viewport as the user scrolls down the page. This ensures continuous visibility of the featured products, maximizing their exposure without being intrusive like a modal popup. It only detaches and scrolls normally if the user scrolls back up past its original position in the document flow.

    4.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    Users can interact with the widget in several ways:
    1.  **Visual Browsing:** Users can visually scan the product cards, viewing images, product names, brief descriptions, pricing information (including discounts if available), and discount badges.
    2.  **Hover Effects:** When a user hovers their mouse over a product card, it lifts slightly and its shadow intensifies. Hovering over a CTA button changes its background color and scales it up slightly. These micro-interactions provide visual feedback that the elements are interactive.
    3.  **Navigation to Product Details:** Clicking on a product's image, its name, or its primary CTA button (e.g., "Shop Now", "Explore Features", "Choose Your Color") is intended to navigate the user to that specific product's detailed page on the e-commerce site. This allows users to get more information or make a purchase decision.
    4.  **Direct Add to Cart (Conceptual):** For CTAs like "Add to Cart", clicking the button would ideally add the product directly to the user's shopping cart. While the provided HTML/CSS sets up the visual, the actual cart functionality would require JavaScript and backend integration.
    5.  **Scrolling Interaction:** As the user scrolls the main page, the entire "Featured Products" section will stick to the top of the viewport (20px down), keeping the featured items accessible.
